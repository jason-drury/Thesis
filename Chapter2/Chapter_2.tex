\chapter{\Kepler Photometry of Field and Cluster stars}
\label{chap:field}

\section*{abstract}
    In this chapter we present new photometry of highly variable stars for the open clusters of NGC\,6791 and NGC\,6819 in the nominal \Kepler~field of view.

\section{Photometric methods}

% Techniques for studying
% > CCDs - Simple ap phot
%       - PS phot
%       - Image sub

\subsection{Simple aperture photometry (SAP)}

\subsection{Point spread function (PSF) photometry}
Pixel response function (PRF) photometry.

\subsection{Image Subtraction}

\section{Initial work}
\subsection{Image subtraction}
Talk about DIAPL Image Subtraction code failure due to code design - pixels too large

\subsection{PSF/PRF Photometry}
\texttt{doctor} - attempt to create custom PSF/PRF photometric code

Show results of failure to converge.


\subsection{Simple box aperture photometry}
Our DIAPL extraction failed to produce image subtracted light curves but did produce some simple box aperture photometric results. We have determined that these are comparable to the MAST photometry, albeit with a reduction in the S/N of approximately $\sqrt2$ in the power of the oscillations in the light curves.

\section{Data Processing}

% Comparison of RG's PS to MAST

% Number of LCs? ~1200
\section{Classification of variable stars}

% Interesting stars
% - RR Lyrae
% - EB's
% - Transits>

\subsection{Rotational variables}

\subsection{Eclipsing binaries}

\subsection{Other variables}
