\chapter{\Kepler Photometry of Field and Cluster stars}

\section{Initial work}
\subsection{Image subtraction}
Talk about DIAPL failure and Custom attempt.

\subsection{Simple box aperture photometry}
Did produce some simple box aperture photometric results that are comparable to the MAST photometry, albeit with a reduction in the S/N of approximately $\sqrt2$ in the power of the oscillations in the lightcurves.

Comparison of RG's PS to MAST

Number of LCs? ~1200

Interesting stars
- RR Lyrae
- EB's
- Transits>
