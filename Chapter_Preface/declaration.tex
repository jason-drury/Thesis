%It should be noted that the data used in Chapter~\ref{chapter:ch2} are based on the same raw observations as the thesis {\it `The Host Galaxies of Active Galactic Nuclei: Winds, Morphology, and Star Formation'} submitted by me as part of a Graduate Diploma of Science. However, I re-reduced and flux calibrated the data during my PhD and all analysis presented in this thesis is original.
