This paper was primarily written and edited by me. I performed the extraction, correction, and analysis of the photometric data. The multi-colour photometry was obtained by Aliz Derekas, L\'aszl\'o Szigeti, R\'obert Szak\'ats, Kriszti\'an S\'arneczky, and L\'aszl\'o Moln\'ar. the identification of chemically peculiar signatures was performed by Simon Murphy, and the model-based rotational modulation stability analysis was conducted by Ádám Sódor. Aliz, Tim and Charles helped me determine the variability classification.
