  abstract = {We present a comparison between theoretical, frequency-dependent, damping rates and linewidths of radial-mode oscillations in red giant stars located in the open cluster NGC 6819. The calculations adopt a time-dependent non-local convection model, with the turbulent pressure profile being calibrated to results of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar atmospheres. The linewidths are obtained from extensive peakbagging of Kepler light curves. These observational results are of unprecedented quality owing to the long continuous observations by Kepler. The uniqueness of the Kepler mission also means that, for asteroseismic properties, this is the best data that will be available for a long time to come. We therefore take great care in modelling nine RGB stars in NGC 6819 using information from 3D simulations to obtain realistic temperature stratifications and calibrated turbulent pressure profiles. Our modelled damping rates reproduce well the Kepler observations, including the characteristic depression in the linewidths around the frequency of maximum oscillation power. Furthermore, we thoroughly test the sensitivity of the calculated damping rates to changes in the parameters of the non-local convection model.},

In particular, we derive distance moduli for each individual RGC star, from which we get the mean distance modulus of {$\mu$}0 = 11.520 {$\pm$} 0.105~mag for the cluster when we use reddening from the Kepler Input Catalogue (KIC) for each RGC star. A value of {$\mu$}0 = 11.747 {$\pm$} 0.086~mag is obtained when uniform reddening value E(B-V)=0.15 is used for the cluster. The values of {$\mu$}0 obtained with RGC stars are in agreement with the values in the literature with other methods. We report for the case of Kepler open cluster NGC~6819 that RGC stars can be used as `distance candles' as has been done in the literature with other open clusters.},

  abstract = {We discuss the possibility of finding the birthplaces of open clusters (OC) with ages of several billion years. The proposed method is based on the comparison of the results of the chemical evolution modeling of the Galactic disk with the parameters of the cluster. Five OCs older than 7 Gyr are known: NGC 6791, BH 176, Collinder 261, Berkeley 17, and Berkeley 39. The oxygen and iron abundances in NGC 6791 and the oxygen abundance in BH 176 are twice the solar level, the heavy-element abundances in other clusters are close to the corresponding solar values. According to chemical evolution models, at the time of the formation of the objects considered the regions where the oxygen and iron abundances reached the corresponding levels extended out to 5 kpc from the Galactic center. At present time the OCs considered are located several kpc from the Galactic center. Some of these clusters are located extremely high , about 1 kpc above the disk midplane, i.e., they have been subject to some mechanism that has carried them into orbits uncharacteristic of this type of objects. It follows from a comparison with the results of chemical evolution that younger clusters with ages of 4\textendash 5 Gyr, e.g., NGC 1193, M 67, and others, may have formed in a broad range of Galactocentric distances. Their large heights above the disk midplane is sufficient to suggest that these clusters have moved away from their likely birthplaces. Clusters are carried far away from the Galactic disk until the present time: about 40 clusters with ages from 0 to 2 Gyr are observed at heights ranging from 300 to 750 pc.},

  abstract = {Stars lose a significant amount of angular momentum between birth and death, implying that efficient processes transporting it from the core to the surface are active. Space asteroseismology delivered the interior rotation rates of more than a thousand low- and intermediate-mass stars, revealing the following: Single stars rotate nearly uniformly during the core-hydrogen and core-helium burning phases. Stellar cores spin up to a factor of 10 faster than the envelope during the red giant phase. The angular momentum of the helium-burning core of stars is in agreement with the angular momentum of white dwarfs.Observations reveal a strong decrease of core angular momentum when stars have a convective core. Current theory of angular momentum transport fails to explain this. We propose improving the theory with a data-driven approach, whereby angular momentum prescriptions derived frommultidimensional (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations and theoretical considerations are continuously tested against modern observations. The TESS and PLATO space missions have the potential to derive the interior rotation of large samples of stars, including high-mass and metal-poor stars in binaries and clusters. This will provide the powerful observational constraints needed to improve theory and simulations. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

While we understand these processes in general terms, we lack some important ingredients. Seemingly small uncertainties in the input physics of the models (e.g., the opacities or the amount of mixing and of interior rotation) have large consequences for the evolution of stars. The goal of asteroseismology is to improve the description of the interior physics of stars by means of their oscillations, just as global helioseismology led to a huge step forward in our knowledge about the internal structure of the Sun. In this paper we present the current status of asteroseismology by considering case studies of stars with a variety of masses and evolutionary stages. In particular, we outline how the confrontation between the observed oscillation frequencies and those predicted by the models allows us to pinpoint limitations of the input physics of current models and improve them to a level that cannot be reached with any other current method.},

  abstract = {Westerlund 1 (Wd1) is potentially the largest star cluster in the Galaxy. That designation critically depends upon the distance to the cluster, yet the cluster is highly obscured, making luminosity-based distance estimates difficult. Using Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) parallaxes and Bayesian inference, we infer a parallax of \$0.31\textbackslash pm\{0.04\}\$ mas corresponding to a distance of \$3.2\textbackslash pm\{0.4\}\$ kpc. To leverage the combined statistics of all stars in the direction of Wd1, we derive the Bayesian model for a cluster of stars hidden among Galactic field stars; this model includes both the zero-point and astrometric excess noise. We infer the exponential length scale, \$L\$, for field stars; \$L = 0.84\_\{-0.03\}\^\{+0.02\}\$ kpc. This is \textasciitilde 1.7 times smaller than the models used for Bailer-Jones et al. (2018). Previous estimates for the distance to Wd1 ranged from 1.2 to 5.5 kpc, although values around 5 kpc have usually been adopted. The Gaia DR2 parallaxes reduce the uncertainty from a factor of 3 to 15\% and rules out the most often quoted value of 5 kpc with 99\% confidence. This new distance allows for more accurate mass and age determinations for the stars in Wd1. For example, the previously inferred initial mass at the main sequence turnoff was around 40 \$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$; the new Gaia DR2 distance shifts this down to about 25 \$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. This has important implications for our understanding of late stages of stellar evolution, including the initial mass of the magnetar and the LBV in Wd1. Similarly, the new distance suggests that the total cluster mass is about three times lower than previously calculated.},

  abstract = {Investigations of the origin and evolution of the Milky Way disc have long relied on chemical and kinematic identifications of its components to reconstruct our Galactic past. Difficulties in determining precise stellar ages have restricted most studies to small samples, normally confined to the solar neighbourhood. Here, we break this impasse with the help of asteroseismic inference and perform a chronology of the evolution of the disc throughout the age of the Galaxy. We chemically dissect the Milky Way disc population using a sample of red giant stars spanning out to 2 kpc in the solar annulus observed by the Kepler satellite, with the added dimension of asteroseismic ages. Our results reveal a clear difference in age between the low- and high-{$\alpha$} populations, which also show distinct velocity dispersions in the V and W components. We find no tight correlation between age and metallicity nor [{$\alpha$}/Fe] for the high-{$\alpha$} disc stars. Our results indicate that this component formed over a period of more than 2 Gyr with a wide range of [M/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] independent of time. Our findings show that the kinematic properties of young {$\alpha$}-rich stars are consistent with the rest of the high-{$\alpha$} population and different from the low-{$\alpha$} stars of similar age, rendering support to their origin being old stars that went through a mass transfer or stellar merger event, making them appear younger, instead of migration of truly young stars formed close to the Galactic bar.},

We distributed tens of individual oscillation frequencies extracted from the time series of each star among seven modeling teams who applied different methods to determine radii, masses, and ages for all stars in the sample. Comparisons among the different results reveal a good level of agreement in all stellar properties, which is remarkable considering the variety of codes, input physics, and analysis methods employed by the different teams. Average uncertainties are of the order of {$\sim$}2\% in radius, {$\sim$}4\% in mass, and {$\sim$}10\% in age, making this the best-characterized sample of main-sequence stars available to date. Our predicted initial abundances and mixing-length parameters are checked against inferences from chemical enrichment laws {$\Delta$}Y/{$\Delta$}Z and predictions from 3D atmospheric simulations. We test the accuracy of the determined stellar properties by comparing them to the Sun, angular diameter measurements, Gaia parallaxes, and binary evolution, finding excellent agreement in all cases and further confirming the robustness of asteroseismically determined physical parameters of stars when individual frequencies of oscillation are available. Baptised as the Kepler dwarfs LEGACY sample, these stars are the solar-like oscillators with the best asteroseismic properties available for at least another decade. All data used in this analysis and the resulting stellar parameters are made publicly available for the community.},

The ARC2 pipeline identifies and corrects any isolated discontinuities in the light curves and then removes trends common to many light curves. These trends are modelled using the publicly available co-trending basis vectors, within an (approximate) Bayesian framework with `shrinkage' priors to minimize the risk of overfitting and the injection of any additional noise into the corrected light curves, while keeping any astrophysical signals intact. We show that the ARC2 pipeline's performance matches that of the standard Kepler PDC-MAP data products using standard noise metrics, and demonstrate its ability to preserve astrophysical signals using injection tests with simulated stellar rotation and planetary transit signals. Although it is not identical, the ARC2 pipeline can thus be used as an open-source alternative to PDC-MAP, whenever the ability to model the impact of the systematics removal process on other kinds of signal is important.},

  abstract = {Eclipsing binaries have long served as benchmark systems to measure fundamental properties of stars. In recent decades, asteroseismology\textemdash the study of stellar pulsations\textemdash has emerged as a powerful new tool to study the structure and evolution of stars across the H\textendash R diagram. Pulsating stars in eclipsing binary systems are particularly valuable since fundamental properties such as radii and masses can then be determined using two independent techniques. Furthermore, independently measured properties from binary orbits can be used to improve asteroseismic modelling for pulsating stars in which mode identifications are not straightforward. This chapter provides a review of asteroseismic detections in eclipsing binary stars, with a focus on space-based missions such as CoRoT and Kepler and empirical tests of asteroseismic scaling relations for stochastic (`solarlike') oscillations.},

  abstract = {Asteroseismology can provide joint constraints on masses and radii of individual stars. While this approach has been extensively tested for red giant branch (RGB) stars, it has been more difficult to test for helium core-burning red-clump (RC) giants because of the lack of fundamental calibrators. To provide independent mass estimates, we utilize a number of widely used horizontal-branch (HB) models in the literature, and derive photometric masses from a comparison with \$griBVI\_CJHK\_s\$ photometry. Our selected models disagree with each other on the predicted mass-luminosity-temperature relation. We adopt first-order corrections on colors and magnitudes to minimize the dispersion between different models by forcing models to match the observed location in the solar-metallicity cluster M67. Even for these calibrated models, however, the internal consistency between models deteriorates at higher metallicities, and photometric masses become smaller than asteroseismic masses, as seen from metal-rich field RC stars with Gaia parallaxes. Similarly, the average photometric mass for metal-rich NGC 6791 stars ranges from \$0.7\textbackslash{} M\_\textbackslash odot\$ to \$1.1\textbackslash{} M\_\textbackslash odot\$, depending on the specific set of models employed. An ensemble average of the photometric masses (\$0.88\textbackslash pm0.16\textbackslash{} M\_\textbackslash odot\$) in NGC 6791 is marginally consistent with the asteroseismic mass (\$1.16\textbackslash pm0.04\textbackslash{} M\_\textbackslash odot\$). There is a clear tension between the masses that one would predict from photometry for metal-rich field RC stars, asteroseismic masses, and those that would be expected from the ages of stars in the Galactic disk populations and canonical RGB mass loss. We conclude that standard RC models need to be re-examined in light of these powerful new data sets.},

  abstract = {Converting a noisy parallax measurement into a posterior belief over distance requires inference with a prior. Usually, this prior represents beliefs about the stellar density distribution of the Milky Way. However, multiband photometry exists for a large fraction of the Gaia-TGAS Catalog and is incredibly informative about stellar distances. Here, we use 2MASS colors for 1.4 million TGAS stars to build a noise-deconvolved empirical prior distribution for stars in color\textendash magnitude space. This model contains no knowledge of stellar astrophysics or the Milky Way but is precise because it accurately generates a large number of noisy parallax measurements under an assumption of stationarity; that is, it is capable of combining the information from many stars. We use the Extreme Deconvolution (XD) algorithm\textemdash which is an empirical-Bayes approximation to a full-hierarchical model of the true parallax and photometry of every star\textemdash to construct this prior. The prior is combined with a TGAS likelihood to infer a precise photometric-parallax estimate and uncertainty (and full posterior) for every star. Our parallax estimates are more precise than the TGAS catalog entries by a median factor of 1.2 (14\% are more precise by a factor {$>$}2) and they are more precise than the previous Bayesian distance estimates that use spatial priors. We validate our parallax inferences using members of the Milky Way star cluster M67, which is not visible as a cluster in the TGAS parallax estimates but appears as a cluster in our posterior parallax estimates. Our results, including a parallax posterior probability distribution function for each of 1.4 million TGAS stars, are available in companion electronic tables.},

  abstract = {Among the available methods for dating stars, gyrochronology is a powerful one because it requires knowledge of only the star's mass and rotation period. Gyrochronology relations have previously been calibrated using young clusters, with the Sun providing the only age dependence, and are therefore poorly calibrated at late ages. We used rotation period measurements of 310 Kepler stars with asteroseismic ages, 50 stars from the Hyades and Coma Berenices clusters and 6 field stars (including the Sun) with precise age measurements to calibrate the gyrochronology relation, whilst fully accounting for measurement uncertainties in all observable quantities. We calibrated a relation of the form P = An \texttimes{} (B - V - c)b, where P is rotation period in days, A is age in Myr, B and V are magnitudes and a, b and n are the free parameters of our model. We found a = 0.40+-00..305, b = 0.31+-00..0052 and n = 0.55+-00..0029. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were used to explore the posterior probability distribution functions of the gyrochronology parameters and we carefully checked the effects of leaving out parts of our sample, leading us to find that no single relation between rotation period, colour and age can adequately describe all the subsets of our data. The Kepler asteroseismic stars, cluster stars and local field stars cannot all be described by the same gyrochronology relation. The Kepler asteroseismic stars may be subject to observational biases; however, the clusters show unexpected deviations from the predicted behaviour, providing concerns for the overall reliability of gyrochronology as a dating method.},

Preliminary analysis led to [Fe/H] above +0.4 with an anomalously high reddening and an age below 5 Gyr. A revised calibration between (b - y)\textsubscript{0} and [Fe/H] at a given temperature shows that the traditional color-metallicity relations underestimate the color of the turnoff stars at high metallicity. With the revised relation, the metallicity from hk and the reddening for NGC 6791 become [Fe/H] = +0.45 {$\pm$} 0.04 and E(b - y) = 0.113 {$\pm$} 0.012 or E(B - V) = 0.155 {$\pm$} 0.016.

The errors quoted include both the internal and external errors. For NGC 6791, the metallicity from m\textsubscript{1} is a factor of 2 below that from hk, a result that may be coupled to the consistently low metal abundance from DDO photometry of the cluster and the C-deficiency found from high-dispersion spectroscopy. E(B - V) is the same value predicted from Galactic reddening maps. With E(B - V) = 0.15 and [Fe/H] = +0.45, the available isochrones predict an age of 7.0 {$\pm$} 1.0 Gyr and an apparent modulus of (m - M) = 13.60 {$\pm$} 0.15, with the dominant source of the uncertainty arising from inconsistencies among the isochrones. The reanalysis of NGC 6253 with the revised lower reddening confirms that on both the hk and m\textsubscript{1} metallicity scales, NGC 6253, while less than half the age of NGC 6791, remains at least as metal-rich as NGC 6791, if not richer.},

Based upon radial-velocity measurements alone, 47 stars at the turnoff of the cluster color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and 18 giants are identified as potential members. Five turnoff stars exhibit evidence of binarity while proper-motion data eliminate two of the dwarfs as members. The mean cluster radial velocity from probable single-star members is \textendash 29.4 {$\pm$} 1.3 km s \textendash 1 (sd). A discussion of the current estimates for the cluster reddening, derived independently of potential issues with the BV cluster photometry, lead to an adopted reddening of E ( B \textendash{} V ) = 0.22 {$\pm$} 0.04. From equivalent width analyses of 38 probable single-star members near the CMD turnoff, the weighted average abundances are found to be [Fe/H] = +0.43 {$\pm$} 0.01, [Ni/H] = +0.53 {$\pm$} 0.02, and [Si/H] = +0.43 0.03 0.04 , where the errors refer to the standard errors of the weighted mean. Weak evidence is found for a possible decline in metallicity with increasing luminosity among stars at the turnoff. We discuss the possibility that our turnoff stars have been affected by microscopic diffusion. For 15 probable single-star members among the giants, spectrum synthesis leads to abundances of +0.46 0.02 0.03 for [Fe/H]. While NGC 6253 is less than half the age of NGC 6791, it is at least as metal-rich and, within the uncertainties, exhibits the same general abundance pattern as that typified by super-metal-rich dwarfs of the galactic bulge.},

  abstract = {HD 187547 was the first candidate that led to the suggestion that solar-like oscillations are present in {$\delta$} Scuti stars. Longer observations, however, show that the modes interpreted as solar-like oscillations have either very long mode lifetimes, longer than 960 days, or are coherent. These results are incompatible with the nature of ``pure'' stochastic excitation as observed in solar-like stars. Nonetheless, one point is certain: the opacity mechanism alone cannot explain the oscillation spectrum of HD 187547. Here we present new theoretical investigations showing that convection dynamics can intrinsically excite coherent pulsations in the chemically peculiar {$\delta$} Scuti star HD 187547. More precisely, it is the perturbations of the mean Reynold stresses (turbulent pressure) that drives the pulsations and the excitation takes place predominantly in the hydrogen ionization zone.},

We provide the mode frequencies of the oscillations of various stars required to perform a comparison with those obtained from stellar modelling. Methods. We used a time series of nine months of data for each star. The 61 stars observed were categorised in three groups: simple, F-like, and mixed-mode. The simple group includes stars for which the identification of the mode degree is obvious. The F-like group includes stars for which the identification of the degree is ambiguous. The mixed-mode group includes evolved stars for which the modes do not follow the asymptotic relation of low-degree frequencies. Following this categorisation, the power spectra of the 61 main-sequence and subgiant stars were analysed using both maximum likelihood estimators and Bayesian estimators, providing individual mode characteristics such as frequencies, linewidths, and mode heights. We developed and describe a methodology for extracting a single set of mode frequencies from multiple sets derived by different methods and individual scientists.

We show that the mode linewidth at either maximum mode height or maximum amplitude follows a scaling relation with effective temperature, which is a combination of a power law and a lower bound. The typical power-law index is about 13 for the linewidth derived from the maximum mode height, and about 16 for the linewidth derived from the maximum amplitude, while the lower bound is about 0.3 {$\mu$}Hz and 0.7 {$\mu$}Hz, respectively. We stress that this scaling relation is only valid for cool main-sequence stars and subgiants, and does not have any predictive power outside the temperature range of these stars.},

We determine oscillation frequencies, frequency separations, period spacings of mixed modes, and mode visibilities for eight cluster giants. The oscillation parameters show that these stars are helium-core-burning red giants. The eight stars form two groups with very different oscillation power spectra; the four stars with the lowest {$\Delta\nu$} values display rich sets of mixed l=1 modes, while this is not the case for the four stars with higher {$\Delta\nu$}. For the four stars with lowest {$\Delta\nu$}, we determine the asymptotic period spacing of the mixed modes, {$\Delta$}P, which together with the masses we derive for all eight stars suggest that they belong to the so-called secondary clump. Based on the global oscillation parameters, we present initial theoretical stellar modeling that indicates that we can constrain convective-core overshoot on the main sequence and in the helium-burning phase for these {$\sim$}2 Me stars. Finally, our results indicate less mode suppression than predicted by recent theories for magnetic suppression of certain oscillation modes in red giants.},

  abstract = {For the vast majority of stars in the second Gaia data release, reliable distances cannot be obtained by inverting the parallax. A correct inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity of the transformation and the asymmetry of the resulting probability distribution. Here, we infer distances to essentially all 1.33 billion stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the physical properties of, or interstellar extinction toward, individual stars.

  abstract = {Individual mode frequencies have been detected in thousands of individual solar-like oscillators on the red giant branch (RGB). Fitting stellar models to these mode frequencies, however, is more difficult than in main-sequence stars. This is partly because of the uncertain magnitude of the surface effect: the systematic difference between observed and modelled frequencies caused by poor modelling of the near-surface layers. We aim to study the magnitude of the surface effect in RGB stars. Surface effect corrections used for main-sequence targets are potentially large enough to put the non-radial mixed modes in RGB stars out of order, which is unphysical. Unless this can be circumvented, model-fitting of evolved RGB stars is restricted to the radial modes, which reduces the number of available modes. Here, we present a method to suppress gravity modes (g-modes) in the cores of our stellar models, so that they have only pure pressure modes (p-modes). We show that the method gives unbiased results and apply it to three RGB solar-like oscillators in double-lined eclipsing binaries: KIC 8410637, KIC 9540226 and KIC 5640750. In all three stars, the surface effect decreases the model frequencies consistently by about 0.1\textendash 0.3 \textmu Hz at the frequency of maximum oscillation power {$\nu$}max, which agrees with existing predictions from three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. Though our method in essence discards information about the stellar cores, it provides a useful step forward in understanding the surface effect in RGB stars.},

  abstract = {We present the characterization of the Kepler-93 exoplanetary system, based on three years of photometry gathered by the Kepler spacecraft. The duration and cadence of the Kepler observations, in tandem with the brightness of the star, enable unusually precise constraints on both the planet and its host. We conduct an asteroseismic analysis of the Kepler photometry and conclude that the star has an average density of 1.652 {$\pm$} 0.006 g cm-3. Its mass of 0.911 {$\pm$} 0.033 M renders it one of the lowest-mass subjects of asteroseismic study. An analysis of the transit signature produced by the planet Kepler-93b, which appears with a period of 4.72673978 {$\pm$} 9.7 \texttimes{} 10-7 days, returns a consistent but less precise measurement of the stellar density, 1.72+-00..0228 g cm-3. The agreement of these two values lends credence to the planetary interpretation of the transit signal. The achromatic transit depth, as compared between Kepler and the Spitzer Space Telescope, supports the same conclusion. We observed seven transits of Kepler-93b with Spitzer, three of which we conducted in a new observing mode. The pointing strategy we employed to gather this subset of observations halved our uncertainty on the transit radius ratio RP /R . We find, after folding together the stellar radius measurement of 0.919 {$\pm$} 0.011 R with the transit depth, a best-fit value for the planetary radius of 1.481 {$\pm$} 0.019 R{$\oplus$}. The uncertainty of 120 km on our measurement of the planet's size currently renders it one of the most precisely measured planetary radii outside of the solar system. Together with the radius, the planetary mass of 3.8 {$\pm$} 1.5 M{$\oplus$} corresponds to a rocky density of 6.3 {$\pm$} 2.6 g cm-3. After applying a prior on the plausible maximum densities of similarly sized worlds between 1 and 1.5 R{$\oplus$}, we find that Kepler-93b possesses an average density within this group.},

  abstract = {Two years of Kepler data are used to investigate low-frequency variations in A-type stars. In about 875 (40 per cent) A-type stars, the periodogram shows a simple peak and its harmonic. If we assume that the photometric period is the period of rotation, we can derive the equatorial rotational velocity from a suitable radius estimate. It turns out that the distribution of equatorial velocities derived in this way is similar to the distribution of equatorial velocities of A-type main-sequence stars in the general field derived from spectroscopic line broadening, verifying our initial assumption. We suggest that the light variation is due to rotational modulation caused by starspots or some other corotating structure. In many stars the rotation peak in the periodogram has a characteristic shape which is not understood. The light amplitudes are highly variable. We deduce from the amplitude distribution that the sizes of starspots in A-type stars are similar to the largest sunspots. From the widths of the peaks in the periodogram we deduce that differential rotation in these stars is similar to that in the Sun. We find that the period\textendash colour relationship used for gyrochronology in late-type stars extends to early F-type and probably late A-type stars as well. Flares in A-type stars have been recently detected. We add 13 additional A-type flare stars to this sample, which means that about 1.5 per cent of A-type stars in the Kepler field show flares. We conclude that A-type stars are active and, like cooler stars, have starspots and flares.},

We find that the light curves of 39 per cent of these stars can be described by a low-frequency sinusoid and its harmonic, usually with variable amplitude, which we interpret as rotational modulation. A large fraction (32 stars or 28 per cent) might be classified as ellipsoidal variables, but a statistical argument suggests that these are probably rotational variables as well. Ten stars (8 per cent of the total) have a peculiar periodogram feature which is common among A stars. The physical cause of this feature is unknown but very likely related to rotation. The large number of rotating variables suggests that star-spots are common in B stars and indicates that magnetic fields can be generated in radiative stellar envelopes. We find five stars (4 per cent) to be {$\beta$} Cep (BECP) variables, all of which have low frequencies with relatively large amplitudes. The presence of low frequencies in BECP stars is an unsolved problem. There are 21 stars (18 per cent) with multiple low frequencies which could be described as slowly pulsating B (SPB) variables. Other pulsating stars do not fit into the general definition of BECP or SPB variables in that they are cool but pulsate with high frequencies. We assume that these are further examples of the anomalous pulsating stars which in the past have been called `Maia' variables. There are 11 stars (10 per cent) of this type. We also examined 300 B stars observed in the K2 Campaign 0 field. We find 12 BECP/Maia candidates and 15 SPB variables.},

The method is easy to use provided the pulsation frequencies are known. The method is tested using various simulations and applied to two stars which have been previously analysed in the literature.

It is found that HADS occur randomly within the instability strip. The possibility that HADS may be defined by the presence of combination frequencies is discussed. There is a weak tendency for the number of combination frequencies to increase with increasing amplitude of the parent frequencies. However, even stars with very low amplitudes may have detectable combination frequencies. Very few parent modes have a period ratio appropriate to first-overtone and fundamental radial modes. It appears that a high amplitude, in itself, is not useful as a distinguishing feature of {$\delta$} Scuti stars.},

The periodogram shows 14 low-frequency peaks spaced at almost exactly equidistant periods that are shown to be dipole gravity modes. Because the period spacing is practically constant, it can be deduced that the internal rotation period is probably in excess of 1 yr, allowing non-rotating models to be used for frequency matching. For a given metallicity and overshoot parameter, there is a strong correlation between the period spacing and the effective temperature in models covering the main-sequence band. The periods of all 14 dipole modes can be matched with the models to a precision of about 0.1 per cent. In addition, 51 peaks with frequencies in the range 1.7\textendash 2.8 d-1 are identified as combinations of the dipole mode frequencies. Four peaks in the frequency range 12.7\textendash 18.5 d-1, two of which have high amplitudes, identify the star as a {$\delta$} Scuti. An attempt to fit the high frequencies using the restrictions imposed by the dipole gravity modes is not convincing as no unique identification can be made. Combination frequencies involving the {$\delta$} Scuti frequencies and the dipole modes are also present.},

  abstract = {From Kepler data, we show that the incidence of flares on stars drops by only a factor of 4 from K\textendash M dwarfs to A\textendash F stars. Allowing for visibility effects, this implies that the true relative number of flare stars does not change very much from cool dwarfs to hot A stars. The idea that flares on A stars can be attributed to a cool companion has to be rejected because it leads to flare amplitudes two orders of magnitude smaller than actually observed. We confirm that spots on flare stars are generally larger than those on non-flare stars and that flare stars rotate significantly faster than non-flare stars. Analysis of 209 flare stars observed in Kepler short-cadence mode allows accurate measurements of flare shapes and duration. We find that about one-third of the flares have a bump or slope discontinuity on the decaying branch and that flares of long duration are to be found in stars with low surface gravities. Flare energies are strongly correlated with stellar luminosity and radius. The correlation with radius leads to a rough estimate of several tens of gauss for the typical magnetic field associated with a flare. The correlation with stellar luminosity can be understood if the typical flare loop length-scales approximately as the stellar radius. We examined the flare frequency as a function of orbital phase in three eclipsing binaries in which a large number of flares are visible. There appears to be no correlation of flaring with orbital phase, which weakens the hypothesis that flares in close binaries could be a result of reconnection of field lines connecting the two stars.},

The problem of low frequencies in {$\delta$} Sct stars, which occurs in over 98 percent of these stars, is discussed. Gaia DR2 parallaxes were used to obtain precise luminosities, enabling the instability strips of the two classes of variable to be precisely defined. Surprisingly, it turns out that the instability region of the {$\gamma$} Dor stars is entirely within the {$\delta$} Sct instability strip. Thus, {$\gamma$} Dor stars should not be considered a separate class of variable. The observed red and blue edges of the instability strip do not agree with recent model calculations. Stellar pulsation occurs in less than half of the stars in the instability region and arguments are presented to show that this cannot be explained by assuming pulsation at a level too low to be detected. Precise Gaia DR2 luminosities of high-amplitude {$\delta$} Sct stars (HADS) show that most of these are normal {$\delta$} Sct stars and not transition objects. It is argued that current ideas on A star envelopes need to be revised.},

A subset of these stars have a larger light amplitude and asymmetric light curves with larger variation in maximum brightness than in minimum brightness. The beating is mostly a result of two dominant, closely spaced frequencies. A third group of stars shows multiple low frequencies of comparable amplitudes. All three types of star fall in the region of the Hertzsprung\textendash Russell diagram where {$\gamma$} Dor stars are found and we therefore identify them as {$\gamma$} Dor variables. However, stars with migrating star-spots also have symmetric light curves with beats, so it is likely that the sample is contaminated by non-pulsating stars of this type. If we assume that the dominant frequency in stars with beats is the rotational frequency, the resulting distribution of equatorial rotational velocities matches that of field stars of similar temperature and luminosity. We therefore conclude that the pulsation periods of these stars must be close to their rotational periods. The third group with multiple frequencies may be slowly rotating {$\gamma$} Dor stars. This investigation is closely related to the presence of low frequencies in {$\delta$} Scuti stars which we briefly discuss.},

  abstract = {We analyse observations of 1568 {$\delta$} Scuti stars in the public archive of the Kepler satellite. We compare the location of these stars in the Hertzsprung\textendash Russell (HR) diagram with that calculated by linear, non-adiabatic pulsation models. There is generally a good agreement and it appears that many of the hotter {$\delta$} Scuti stars are pulsating in overtones as high as radial order n = 8. Models predict unstable modes of intermediate and high spherical harmonic, l, which are trapped in the envelope. The instability strip for these modes extends well beyond the blue edge for l {$\leq$} 4 and should be visible in the Kepler data. However, stars with these predicted properties are not seen. Moreover, we find that the observed frequency range does not agree with the models. Another challenge is to understand why more than half of the stars in the {$\delta$} Sct instability strip are not pulsating. The distribution of amplitudes argues strongly against the notion that the pulsation amplitudes are below the Kepler detection limit. The mode density of {$\delta$} Scuti stars is surprisingly low and suggests that modes of a high degree are not common. We do not find any stars with mode densities as high as that found in the CoRoT observations of HD 50844. The periodograms of stars in the same part of the HR diagram vary widely. However, we have identified a group of {$\delta$} Scuti stars characterized by a single dominant frequency in which a period\textendash luminosity law is present. In many cases the dominant frequency is accompanied by a close frequency of lower amplitude.},

  abstract = {Optical flares on early F- and A-type stars have never been observed with certainty. Inspection of several thousands of these stars in the Kepler public archives resulted in the discovery of flares in 25 G-type and 27 F-type stars. Because A-type stars are thought not to be active, the detection of flares on 19 A-type stars from a sample of nearly 2000 A stars is particularly noteworthy. The flares have relative intensities in the range 1\textendash 100 parts per thousand and typical durations of a few minutes to several hours. The mean interval between flares varies between 1 and 120 days. We estimate the typical energy of flares to be around 1035 erg in the F-type stars and about 1036 erg in the A-type stars. Nearly all these stars vary at a low level with a period which is most likely the rotational period of the star. Comparison of the relative flare intensities with those in cool red stars observed by Kepler shows that flares in these stars, and certainly in the A-type stars, cannot easily be ascribed to cool flare-star companions. The huge energy released in the flares is difficult to understand. This is especially the case for A-type stars since these stars are thought to have very weak magnetic fields. The flare energy may possibly originate in magnetic reconnection of field lines between the primary star and a companion.},

We find that multiple peaks in the range 0\textendash 5 d-1 are found in nearly all {$\delta$} Scuti stars, even those well outside the blue edge of the {$\gamma$} Doradus instability strip. All {$\delta$} Sct stars are essentially {$\delta$} Sct/{$\gamma$} Dor hybrids. The reason why this fact was not recognized from groundbased observations is due to the fact that the low frequencies reach maximum amplitude close to the blue edge of the {$\gamma$} Dor instability strip. Stars which do not have high frequencies characteristic of {$\delta$} Sct pulsations also do not have low frequencies. The amplitudes of the low frequencies correlate with the amplitudes of the {$\delta$} Sct pulsations. The low frequencies have long lifetimes similar to those of the {$\delta$} Sct modes. They are therefore not excited by a stochastic mechanism. We show that the low frequencies cannot be explained as non-linear combinations of {$\delta$} Sct modes. By comparing the observed distribution of frequencies with those from {$\delta$} Sct models, we show that low-frequency peaks cannot be explained as a result of rotational perturbation of high-frequency {$\delta$} Sct modes. We find that the number of lowfrequency peaks increases with rotation, but Rossby and Kelvin modes can be ruled out as possible candidates. The presence of low frequencies in A stars would be explained if the convective blocking mechanism continues to be active even in the hottest A stars.},

  abstract = {Two different mechanisms may act to induce quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) in whole-disc observations of stellar flares. One mechanism may be magnetohydromagnetic forces and other processes acting on flare loops as seen in the Sun. The other mechanism may be forced local acoustic oscillations due to the high-energy particle impulse generated by the flare (known as `sunquakes' in the Sun). We analyse short-cadence Kepler data of 257 flares in 75 stars to search for QPP in the flare decay branch or post-flare oscillations which may be attributed to either of these two mechanisms. About 18 per cent of stellar flares show a distinct bump in the flare decay branch of unknown origin. The bump does not seem to be a highly damped global oscillation because the periods of the bumps derived from wavelet analysis do not correlate with any stellar parameter. We detected damped oscillations covering several cycles (QPP), in seven flares on five stars. The periods of these oscillations also do not correlate with any stellar parameter, suggesting that these may be a due to flare loop oscillations. We searched for forced global oscillations which might result after a strong flare. To this end, we investigated the behaviour of the amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in eight stars before and after a flare. However, no clear amplitude change could be detected. We also analysed the amplitudes of the self-excited pulsations in two {$\delta$} Scuti stars and one {$\gamma$} Doradus star before and after a flare. Again, no clear amplitude changes were found. Our conclusions are that a new process needs to be found to explain the high incidence of bumps in stellar flare light curves, that flare loop oscillations may have been detected in a few stars and that no conclusive evidence exists as yet for flare induced global acoustic oscillations (starquakes).},

This feature consists of a broad peak, thought to be due to differential rotation in a spotted star, and a sharp peak at slightly higher frequency. The pattern clearly involves some widespread stellar property and the sharp peak implies a strictly coherent periodicity. We investigate the possibility that the periodicity is due to rotation, pulsation or an orbital effect. We argue that neither rotation nor pulsation can provide a suitable, testable, explanation. We suggest that the sharp feature could be due to a planet in synchronous orbit around the rapidly rotating, spotted A star, not necessarily in transit. Spectroscopic observations of sufficient precision are required to falsify this hypothesis.},

To minimize errors in the estimated stellar parameters, we divided the instability strip into 10 regions and determined the mean frequency distribution in each region. We confirm that the presence of low frequencies is a property of all {$\delta$} Sct stars, rendering meaningless the concept of {$\delta$} Sct/{$\gamma$} Dor hybrids. We obtained the true distribution of equatorial rotational velocities in each region and calculated the frequency distributions predicted by pulsation models, taking into account rotational splitting of the frequencies. We confirm that rotation cannot account for the presence of low frequencies. We calculated a large variety of standard pulsation models with different metal and helium abundances, but were unable to obtain unstable low-frequency modes driven by the {$\kappa$} mechanism in any model. We also constructed models with modified opacities in the envelope. Increasing the opacity at a temperature log T = 5.06 by a factor of 2 does lead to instability of low-degree modes at low frequencies, but also decreases the frequency range of {$\delta$} Sct-type pulsations to some extent. We also re-affirm the fact that less than half of the stars in the {$\delta$} Sct instability strip have pulsations detectable by Kepler. We also point out the huge variety of frequency patterns in stars with roughly similar parameters, suggesting that non-linearity is an important factor in {$\delta$} Sct pulsations.},

  abstract = {A new perspective of pulsation in stars within the {$\delta$} Scuti instability strip has recently emerged as a result of Kepler observations. The majority of stars within the instability strip do not pulsate and practically all {$\delta$} Scuti stars contain low frequencies. Because {$\gamma$} Doradus stars co-exist with {$\delta$} Sct stars in the same region of the instability strip, it follows that {$\gamma$} Dor stars are driven by the same mechanism as {$\delta$} Sct stars. The difference must be due to different mode selection processes. The search for an unknown damping factor which is missing from the models will be essential for further progress. Maia variables and hot {$\gamma$} Dor stars are briefly discussed. Luminosities of roAp stars obtained from Gaia DR2 parallaxes and spectroscopic effective temperatures show that the roAp stars are slightly evolved with temperatures in the range 6300\textendash 8300 K, considerably cooler than predicted by the models. The roAp stars and stars with solar-like oscillations share the same mass - temperature - luminosity relation, but with frequencies which are about 50 percent higher. This suggests that roAp frequencies are determined by the critical acoustic frequency, but this frequency is larger than in standard models, perhaps as a result of a temperature inversion in the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Photometry of KIC 10483436 was obtained continuously with 1-min exposures over a 27-d period from the Kepler satellite. The light curve shows rotational variations from surface spots with a period of 4.303 {$\pm$} 0.002 d, an amplitude of about 6 mmag and eight pulsation frequencies typical of roAp stars. The high-frequency pattern consists of a quintuplet of equally spaced peaks where the frequency of the dominant central peak (68 \textmu mag amplitude) is 1353.00 \textmu Hz (P = 12.32 min). A second set of three peaks of lower amplitude are also visible. These appear to form part of a quintuplet centred on 1511.6 \textmu Hz with the central peak and one side peak missing. The equidistant frequency spacing is 2.69 \textmu Hz, which corresponds to the 4.303 d rotation period. However, the amplitudes (12 \textmu mag) of these peaks are too close to the detection level to allow definite identification of the multiplets. Although no spectrum is available, the character of the pulsations shows that this is a roAp star with two high-frequency modes modulated in amplitude in accordance with the oblique pulsator model. The 4.303-d variation in the light curve, which is interpreted as rotational modulation, shows harmonics as high as the 26th. These harmonics are probably a result of many patches of varying surface brightness associated with surface abundance variations characteristic of Ap stars.},

Gaia DR2 parallaxes were used to estimate luminosities, from which the radii and equatorial rotational velocities can be deduced. It is shown that observed values of the projected rotational velocities are lower than the estimated equatorial velocities for nearly all the stars, as they should be if rotation is the cause of the light variation.

One of these ranges coincides with the KIC distance modulus. The rotation periods of main-sequence stars are correlated with colour, so that a period-age-mass relation can be derived from open clusters and applied to stars of unknown ages. Surprisingly, we find that the correlation applies not only to cool stars, but extends to A-type stars in the cluster.

Here we present an overview of M giant variability on a wide range of time-scales (hours to years), based on the analysis of 13 quarters of Kepler long-cadence observations (one point per every 29.4 min), with a total time-span of over 1000 d. About two-thirds of the sample stars have been selected from the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS)-North survey of the Kepler field, with the rest supplemented from a randomly chosen M giant control sample. We first describe the correction of the light curves from different quarters, which was found to be essential. We use Fourier analysis to calculate multiple frequencies for all stars in the sample. Over 50 stars show a relatively strong signal with a period equal to the Kepler-year and a characteristic phase dependence across the whole field of view. We interpret this as a so far unidentified systematic effect in the Kepler data. We discuss the presence of regular patterns in the distribution of multiple periodicities and amplitudes. In the period\textendash amplitude plane we find that it is possible to distinguish between solar-like oscillations and larger amplitude pulsations which are characteristic for Mira/semiregular stars. This may indicate the region of the transition between two types of oscillations as we move upward along the giant branch.},

  abstract = {Kepler-91b is a rare example of a transiting hot Jupiter around a red giant star, providing the possibility to study the formation and composition of hot Jupiters under different conditions compared to main-sequence stars. However, the planetary nature of Kepler-91b, which was confirmed using phase-curve variations by Lillo-Box et al., was recently called into question based on a re-analysis of Kepler data. We have obtained ground-based radial velocity observations from the Hobby\textendash Eberly Telescope and unambiguously confirm the planetary nature of Kepler-91b by simultaneously modeling the Kepler and radial velocity data. The star exhibits temporally correlated noise due to stellar granulation which we model as a Gaussian Process. We hypothesize that it is this noise component that led previous studies to suspect Kepler-91b to be a false positive. Our work confirms the conclusions presented by Lillo-Box et al. that Kepler-91b is a 0.73 {$\pm$} 0.13 MJup planet orbiting a red giant star.},

We define a diagnostic that characterizes the median differential intensity change between data bins of a given timescale. We apply the same diagnostics to Solar and Heliospheric Observatory data that has been rendered comparable to Kepler. The Sun exhibits similar photometric variability on all timescales as comparable solar-type stars in the Kepler field. The previously defined photometric ``range'' serves as our activity proxy (driven by starspot coverage). We revisit the fraction of comparable stars in the Kepler field that are more active than the Sun. The exact active fraction depends on what is meant by ``more active than the Sun'' and on the magnitude limit of the sample of stars considered. This active fraction is between a quarter and a third (depending on the timescale). We argue that a reliable result requires timescales of half a day or longer and stars brighter than MKep of 14, otherwise non-stellar noise distorts it. We also analyze main sequence stars grouped by temperature from 6500 to 3500 K. As one moves to cooler stars, the active fraction of stars becomes steadily larger (greater than 90\% for early M dwarfs). The Sun is a good photometric model at all timescales for those cooler stars that have long-term variability within the span of solar variability.},

This data set constitutes an unprecedented study of stellar variability given its great precision and complete time coverage (with a half hour cadence). Because the full Kepler pipeline is not currently suitable for a study of stellar variability of this sort, we describe our procedures for treating the ``raw'' pipeline data. About half of the total sample exhibits convincing periodic variability up to two weeks, with amplitudes ranging from differential intensity changes of less than 10-4 up to more than 10\%. K and M dwarfs have a greater fraction of period behavior than G dwarfs. The giants in the sample have distinctive quasi-periodic behavior, but are not periodic in the way we define it. Not all periodicities are due to rotation, and the most significant period is not necessarily the rotation period. We discuss properties of the light curves, and in particular look at a sample of very clearly periodic G dwarfs. It is clear that a large number of them do vary because of rotation and starspots, but it will take further analysis to fully exploit this.},

Using Gaia DR2 proper motions and parallax measurements we are able to select a clean sample of cluster members. This cluster displays a clear extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO), a phenomenon previously studied mainly in young and intermediate age massive clusters in the Magellanic clouds. The main sequence of NGC\textasciitilde 2818 is extremely narrow, with a width of \$\textbackslash sim0.01\$ magnitudes (G\$\_\{\textbackslash rm BP\} - \$ G\$\_\{\textbackslash rm RP\}\$), suggesting very low levels of differential extinction. Using VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy of 60 cluster members to measure the rotational velocity of the stars (Vsini) we find that stars on the red side of the eMSTO have high Vsini (\${$>$}160\$\textasciitilde km/s) while stars on the blue side have low Vsini (\${$<$}160\$\textasciitilde km/s), in agreement with model predictions. The cluster also follows the previously discovered trend between the age of the cluster and the extent of the eMSTO. We conclude that stellar rotation is the likely cause of the eMSTO phenomenon.},

These abundance variations can be observed spectroscopically and also photometrically, with the appropriate choice of filters, due to the changing of spectral features within the band pass. This phenomenon is observed in nearly all of the ancient GCs, although, to date, it has not been found in any massive cluster younger than 2 Gyr. Many scenarios have been suggested to explain this phenomenon, with most invoking multiple epochs of star formation within the cluster; however, all have failed to reproduce various key observations, in particular when a global view of the GC population is taken. We review the state of current observations and outline the successes and failures of each of the main proposed models. The traditional idea of using the stellar ejecta from a first generation of stars to form a second generation of stars, while conceptually straightforward, has failed to reproduce an increasing number of observational constraints. We conclude that the puzzle of multiple populations remains unsolved, hence alternative theories are needed.},

Recent work has demonstrated that the short-timescale brightness variations (``flicker'') of stars can be used to measure log g to a high accuracy of {$\sim$}0.1\textendash 0.2 dex. Here, we use flicker measurements of 289 bright (Kepmag {$<$} 13) candidate planet-hosting stars with Teff = 4500\textendash 6650 K to re-assess the stellar parameters and determine the resulting impact on derived planet properties. This re-assessment reveals that for the brightest planet-host stars, Malmquist bias contaminates the stellar sample with evolved stars: nearly 50\% of the bright planet-host stars are subgiants. As a result, the stellar radii, and hence the radii of the planets orbiting these stars, are on average 20\%\textendash 30\% larger than previous measurements had suggested.},

We newly derive rotation periods from the Kepler light curves for all of the stars in our study sample. The RV variations reported herein range from less than 4 to 135 m s-1, yet the stars all have amplitudes of photometric variability less than 3 mmag, reflecting the preference of the RV program for chromospherically ``quiet'' stars. Despite the small size of our sample, we find with high statistical significance that the RV rms manifests strongly in the Fourier power spectrum of the light curve: stars that are noisier in RV have a greater number of frequency components in the light curve. We also find that spot models of the observed light curves systematically underpredict the observed RV variations by factors of {$\sim$}2\textendash 1000, likely because the low-level photometric variations in our sample are driven by processes not included in simple spot models. The stars best fit by these models tend to have simpler light curves, dominated by a single relatively high-amplitude component of variability. Finally, we demonstrate that the RV rms behavior of our sample can be explained in the context of the photometric variability evolutionary diagram introduced by Bastien et al. We use this diagram to derive the surface gravities of the stars in our sample, revealing many of them to have moved off the main sequence. More generally, we find that the stars with the largest RV rms are those that have evolved onto the ``flicker floor'' sequence in that diagram, characterized by relatively low amplitude but highly complex photometric variations which grow as the stars evolve to become subgiants.},

In fact, our knowledge is good enough to use the Sun as a laboratory. We have also been able to study the dynamics of the Sun in great detail. Helioseismic data also allow us to probe the changes that take place in the Sun as solar activity waxes and wanes. The seismic study of stars other than the Sun is a fairly new endeavour, but we are making great strides in this field. In this review I discuss some of the techniques used in helioseismic analyses and the results obtained using those techniques. I focus on results obtained with global helioseismology, i.e., the study of the Sun using its normal modes of oscillation. I also briefly touch upon asteroseismology, the seismic study of stars other than the Sun, and discuss how seismic data of others stars are interpreted. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

In addition to estimating the mass, radius, and log g of stars on the red giant branch (RGB) of these clusters, we estimate the distance to the clusters and their ages. Our model-independent estimate of the distance modulus of NGC 6791 is (m - M )0 = 13.11 {$\pm$} 0.06. We find (m - M )0 = 11.85 {$\pm$} 0.05 for NGC 6819. The average mass of stars on the RGB of NGC 6791 is 1.20 {$\pm$} 0.01 M , while that of NGC 6819 is 1.68 {$\pm$} 0.03 M . It should be noted that we do not have data that cover the entire RGB and the actual mass will be somewhat lower. We have determined model-dependent estimates of ages of these clusters. We find ages between 6.8 and 8.6 Gyr for NGC 6791, however, most sets of models give ages around 7 Gyr. We obtain ages between 2 and 2.4 Gyr for NGC 6819.},

Its legacy will be a catalog of discoveries sufficient for computing planet occurrence rates as a function of size, orbital period, star type, and insolation flux. The mission has made significant progress toward achieving that goal. Over 3,500 transiting exoplanets have been identified from the analysis of the first 3 y of data, 100 planets of which are in the habitable zone. The catalog has a high reliability rate (85\textendash 90\% averaged over the period/radius plane), which is improving as follow-up observations continue. Dynamical (e.g., velocimetry and transit timing) and statistical methods have confirmed and characterized hundreds of planets over a large range of sizes and compositions for both single- and multiple-star systems. Population studies suggest that planets abound in our galaxy and that small planets are particularly frequent.

  abstract = {NASA's Kepler Mission uses transit photometry to determine the frequency of Earth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of Sun-like stars. The mission reached a milestone toward meeting that goal: the discovery of its first rocky planet, Kepler-10b. Two distinct sets of transit events were detected: (1) a 152 {$\pm$} 4 ppm dimming lasting 1.811 {$\pm$} 0.024 hr with ephemeris T [BJD] = 2454964.57375+-00..0000006802 + N {${_\ast}$} 0.837495+-00..000000000045 days and (2) a 376 {$\pm$} 9 ppm dimming lasting 6.86 {$\pm$} 0.07 hr with ephemeris T [BJD] = 2454971.6761+-00..00002203 + N {${_\ast}$} 45.29485+-00..0000006756 days. Statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established the viability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-up observations. Forty precision Doppler measurements were used to confirm that the short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. The parent star is bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. Photometry was collected at 1 minute cadence for {$>$}4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsation frequencies. Modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of the fundamental stellar properties. Kepler10 is a relatively old (11.9 {$\pm$} 4.5 Gyr) but otherwise Sun-like main-sequence star with Teff = 5627 {$\pm$} 44 K, M = 0.895 {$\pm$} 0.060 M , and R = 1.056 {$\pm$} 0.021 R . Physical models simultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision Doppler measurements yielded tight constraints on the properties of Kepler-10b that speak to its rocky composition: MP = 4.56+-11..1279 M{$\oplus$}, RP = 1.416+-00..003336 R{$\oplus$}, and {$\rho$}P = 8.8+-22..19 g cm-3.

  abstract = {The unparalleled photometric data obtained by NASA's \emph{Kepler{$<$}i/{$>$} Space Telescope has led to an improved understanding of stellar structure and evolution - in particular for solar-like oscillators in this context. Binary stars are fascinating objects. Because they were formed together, binary systems provide a set of two stars with very well constrained parameters. Those can be used to study properties and physical processes, such as the stellar rotation, dynamics and rotational mixing of elements and allows us to learn from the differences we find between the two components. In this work, we discussed a detailed study of the binary system KIC 9163796, discovered through \emph{Kepler{$<$}i/{$>$} photometry. The ground-based follow-up spectroscopy showed that this system is a double-lined spectroscopic binary, with a mass ratio close to unity. However, the fundamental parameters of the components of this system as well as their lithium abundances differ substantially. \emph{Kepler{$<$}i/{$>$} photometry of this system allows to perform a detailed seismic analysis as well as to derive the orbital period and the surface rotation rate of the primary component of the system. Indications of the seismic signature of the secondary are found. The differing parameters are best explained with both components located in the early and the late phase of the first dredge up at the bottom of the red-giant branch. Observed lithium abundances in both components are in good agreement with prediction of stellar models including rotational mixing. By combining observations and theory, a comprehensive picture of the system can be drawn.}}}},

Convection takes place over much of the star's radius. Conservation of angular momentum requires that the cores of these stars rotate faster than their envelopes; indirect evidence supports this1,2. Information about the angular-momentum distribution is inaccessible to direct observations, but it can be extracted from the effect of rotation on oscillation modes that probe the stellar interior. Here we report an increasing rotation rate from the surface of the star to the stellar core in the interiors of red giants, obtained using the rotational frequency splitting of recently detected `mixed modes'3,4. By comparison with theoretical stellar models, we conclude that the core must rotate at least ten times faster than the surface. This observational result confirms the theoretical prediction of a steep gradient in the rotation profile towards the deep stellar interior1,5,6.},

We then observe the Kepler solar analogue KIC 3241581 (S /N {$\sim$} 170). For this star, the fundamental spectral parameters are extracted using a differential analysis. Sufficient S/N in the near ultraviolet allows us to investigate the chromospheric magnetic activity in both objects. Results. We constructed three solar spectrum atlases from 385 to 900 nm, obtained with the HERMES spectrograph from observations of two bright asteroids and a jovian moon. A comparison between our solar spectra atlas to the Kurucz and HARPS solar spectrum shows an excellent agreement. KIC 3241581 was found to be a long-periodic binary system. The fundamental parameter for the stellar primary component are Teff = 5689 {$\pm$} 11 K, log g = 4.385 {$\pm$} 0.005, [Fe/H] = +0.22 {$\pm$} 0.01, being in agreement with the published global seismic values, which confirms its status as solar analogue. The chromospheric activity level is compatible with the solar magnetic activity observed during 2014 and 2015. Conclusions. Our solar atlas is an essential tool for the analysis of solar-like stars and to characterise solar analogues and twins with HERMES. The differential analysis, using the presented solar atlas from HERMES observations allows us to obtain the fundamental parameters with very high accuracy.

  abstract = {Methods. We selected a sample of 18 solar-analogue stars observed by the NASA Kepler satellite for an in-depth analysis. Their seismic properties and surface rotation rates are well constrained from previous studies. About 53 h of high-resolution spectroscopy were obtained to derive fundamental parameters from spectroscopy and A(Li). These values were combined and compared with seismic masses, radii, and ages, as well as with surface rotation periods measured from Kepler photometry. Results. Based on radial velocities, we identify and confirm a total of six binary star systems. For each star, a signal-to-noise ratio of 80 S /N 210 was typically achieved in the final spectrum around the lithium line. We report fundamental parameters and A(Li). Using the surface rotation period derived from Kepler photometry, we obtained a well-defined relation between A(Li) and rotation. The seismic radius translates the surface rotation period into surface velocity. With models constrained by the characterisation of the individual mode frequencies for single stars, we identify a sequence of three solar analogues with similar mass ({$\sim$}1.1 M ) and stellar ages ranging between 1 to 9 Gyr. Within the realistic estimate of {$\sim$}7\% for the mass uncertainty, we find a good agreement between the measured A(Li) and the predicted A(Li) evolution from a grid of models calculated with the Toulouse-Geneva stellar evolution code, which includes rotational internal mixing, calibrated to reproduce solar chemical properties. We found a scatter in ages inferred from the global seismic parameters that is too large when compared with A(Li). Conclusions. We present the Li-abundance for a consistent spectroscopic survey of solar-analogue stars with a mass of 1.00 {$\pm$} 0.15 M that are characterised through asteroseismology and surface rotation rates based on Kepler observations. The correlation between A(Li) and Prot supports the gyrochronological concept for stars younger than the Sun and becomes clearer when the confirmed binaries are excluded. The consensus between measured A(Li) for solar analogues with model grids, calibrated on the Sun's chemical properties, suggests that these targets share the same internal physics. In this light, the solar Li and rotation rate appear to be normal for a star like the Sun.},

  abstract = {Methods. We applied asteroseismic techniques to determine the masses and radii of the primary component of each system. For a selected target, light and radial velocity curve modelling techniques were applied to extract the parameters of the system and its primary component. Stellar evolution and its effects on the evolution of the binary system were studied from theoretical models. Results. The paper presents the asteroseismic analysis of 18 pulsating red giants in eccentric binary systems, for which masses and radii were constrained. The orbital periods of these systems range from 20 to 440 days. The results of our ongoing radial velocity monitoring programme with the Hermes spectrograph reveal an eccentricity range of e = 0.2 to 0.76. As a case study we present a detailed analysis of KIC 5006817, whose rich oscillation spectrum allows for detailed seismic analysis. From seismology we constrain the rotational period of the envelope to be at least 165 d, which is roughly twice the orbital period. The stellar core rotates 13 times faster than the surface. From the spectrum and radial velocities we expect that the Doppler beaming signal should have a maximum amplitude of 300 ppm in the light curve. Fixing the mass and radius to the asteroseismically determined values, we find from our binary modelling a value of the gravity darkening exponent that is significantly larger than expected. Through binary modelling, we determine the mass of the secondary component to be 0.29 {$\pm$} 0.03 M . Conclusions. For KIC 5006817 we exclude pseudo-synchronous rotation of the red giant with the orbit. The comparison of the results from seismology and modelling of the light curve shows a possible alignment of the rotational and orbital axis at the 2{$\sigma$} level. Red giant eccentric systems could be progenitors of cataclysmic variables and hot subdwarf B stars.},

  abstract = {Methods. We analysed four years of Kepler space photometry and we obtained high-resolution spectroscopy with the Hermes instrument. The orbital elements and the spectra of both components were determined using spectral disentangling methods. The effective temperatures, and metallicities were extracted from disentangled spectra of the two stars. Mass and radius of the primary were determined through asteroseismology. The surface rotation period of the primary is determined from the Kepler light curve. From representative theoretical models of the star, we derived the internal rotational gradient, while for a grid of models, the measured lithium abundance is compared with theoretical predictions. Results. From seismology the primary of KIC 9163796 is a star of 1.39 {$\pm$} 0.06 M , while the spectroscopic mass ratio between both components can be determined with much higher precision by spectral disentangling to be 1.015 {$\pm$} 0.005. With such mass and a difference in effective temperature of 600 K from spectroscopy, the secondary and primary are, respectively, in the early and advanced stage of the first dredge-up event on the red-giant branch. The period of the primary's surface rotation resembles the orbital period within ten days. The radial rotational gradient between the surface and core in KIC 9163796 is found to be 6.9+-21..00. This is a low value but not exceptional if compared to the sample of typical single field stars. The seismic average of the envelope's rotation agrees with the surface rotation rate. The lithium'abundance is in agreement with quasi rigidly rotating models. Conclusions. The agreement between the surface rotation with the seismic result indicates that the full convective envelope is rotating quasi-rigidly. The models of the lithium abundance are compatible with a rigid rotation in the radiative zone during the main sequence. Because of the many constraints offered by oscillating stars in binary systems, such objects are important test beds of stellar evolution.},

  abstract = {Tidal interaction governs the redistribution of angular momentum in close binary stars and planetary systems and determines the systems evolution towards the possible equilibrium state. Turbulent friction acting on the equilibrium tide in the convective envelope of low-mass stars is known to have a strong impact on this exchange of angular momentum in binaries. Moreover, theoretical modelling in recent literature as well as presented in this paper suggests that the dissipation of the dynamical tide, constituted of tidal inertial waves propagating in the convective envelope, is weak compared to the dissipation of the equilibrium tide during the red giant phase. This prediction is confirmed when we apply the equilibrium-tide formalism developed by Zahn, Verbunt \& Phinney, and Remus, Mathis \& Zahn on to the sample of all known red giant binaries observed by the NASA Kepler mission. Moreover, the observations are adequately explained by only invoking the equilibrium tide dissipation. Such ensemble analysis also benefits from the seismic characterization of the oscillating components and surface rotation rates. Through asteroseismology, previous claims of the eccentricity as an evolutionary state diagnostic are discarded. This result is important for our understanding of the evolution of multiple star and planetary systems during advanced stages of stellar evolution.},

  abstract = {Red giants are evolved stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores and instead burn hydrogen in a surrounding shell1,2. Once a red giant is sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes fusion3. Outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include uncertainties in the amount of mass lost at the surface before helium ignition and the amount of internal mixing from rotation and other processes4. Progress is hampered by our inability to distinguish between red giants burning helium in the core and those still only burning hydrogen in a shell. Asteroseismology offers a way forward, being a powerful tool for probing the internal structures of stars using their natural oscillation frequencies5. Here we report observations of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants6 that permit a distinction between evolutionary stages to be made. We use high-precision photometry obtained by the Kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure oscillations in several hundred red giants. We find many stars whose dipole modes show sequences with approximately regular period spacings. These stars fall into two clear groups, allowing us to distinguish unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars (period spacing mostly {$\sim$}50 seconds) and those that are also burning helium (period spacing {$\sim$}100 to 300 seconds).},

  abstract = {We have measured solar-like oscillations in red giants using time-series photometry from the first 34 days of science operations of the Kepler Mission. The light curves, obtained with 30 minute sampling, reveal clear oscillations in a large sample of G and K giants, extending in luminosity from the red clump down to the bottom of the giant branch. We confirm a strong correlation between the large separation of the oscillations ({$\Delta\nu$}) and the frequency of maximum power ({$\nu$}max). We focus on a sample of 50 low-luminosity stars ({$\nu$}max {$>$} 100 {$\mu$}Hz, L {$\lessequivlnt$} 30 L {$\Sun$}) having high signal-to-noise ratios and showing the unambiguous signature of solar-like oscillations. These are H-shell-burning stars, whose oscillations should be valuable for testing models of stellar evolution and for constraining the star formation rate in the local disk. We use a new technique to compare stars on a single \'echelle diagram by scaling their frequencies and find well-defined ridges corresponding to radial and non-radial oscillations, including clear evidence for modes with angular degree l = 3. Measuring the small separation between l = 0 and l = 2 allows us to plot the so-called C-D diagram of {$\delta\nu$}02 versus {$\Delta\nu$}. The small separation {$\delta\nu$}01 of l = 1 from the midpoint of adjacent l = 0 modes is negative, contrary to the Sun and solar-type stars. The ridge for l = 1 is notably broadened, which we attribute to mixed modes, confirming theoretical predictions for low-luminosity giants. Overall, the results demonstrate the tremendous potential of Kepler data for asteroseismology of red giants.},

  abstract = {We propose to study the last HST-accessible white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence (CS) for a nearby globular cluster (GC), the chemically complex, extreme blue horizontal branch cluster NGC 6752. Over 97\% of stars end their lives as WDs, and the WD CS provides constraints not only on the age, but also potentially the star formation history of a GC. The CS of WDs also lies in the least-explored region of the color-magnitude diagram of old stellar populations. Recent deep imaging with HST has successfully reached the end of the WD CS in only three classical old GCs, M4, NGC 6397 and 47 Tuc, and reveals an unexpectedly complex, and double-peaked, WD CS in the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791. One more investigation is in progress on the massive globular Omega Centauri, where over 14 sub-populations are known to exist.While almost every cluster is known to host multiple populations, every single cluster is unique. NGC 6752 is a bridge between the relatively simple globular clusters, and Omega Cen, the most complex globular cluster known. NGC 6752 has an extended blue horizontal branch, a collapsed core and 3 chemically distinct populations. It is our last chance to add diversity to our very limited sample of WD CS, so far containing only 3 globular clusters, one old open cluster, and the complex Omega Cen system. We need to undertake this investigation while HST is still operational, as there is no foreseeable opportunity in the post-HST era to have one extra WD CS in the homogeneus optical photometric system of HST.},

Further calculations demonstrate that most short period systems will synchronize their orbits during the Main Sequence, then evolve to circular orbits in the sub-giant phase. The distortions which can be expected along the centerlines of stars in the Main Sequence is described analytically, noting that the distortion takes the form of an expansion into the Roche lobe. The models are used to generate light curves for suspected ellipsoidal variables, e.g., beta Lyrae, with satisfactory results. Similarly, the spectroscopic signatures of ellipsoidal systems exhibit dual peaked features which vary, a characteristic which can also be understood in terms of the filling of the Roche lobe.},

  abstract = {Detecting the presence and characteristic scale of a signal is a common problem in data analysis. We develop a fast statistical test of the null hypothesis that a Fourier-like power spectrum is consistent with noise. The null hypothesis is rejected where the local `coefficient of variation' (CV) \textendash{} the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean \textendash{} in a power spectrum deviates significantly from expectations for pure noise (CV {$\approx$} 1.0 for a {$\chi$} 2 2-degrees-offreedom distribution). This technique is of particular utility for detecting signals in power spectra with frequency-dependent noise backgrounds, as it is only sensitive to features that are sharp relative to the inspected frequency bin width. We develop a CV-based algorithm to quickly detect the presence of solar-like oscillations in photometric power spectra that are dominated by stellar granulation. This approach circumvents the need for background fitting to measure the frequency of maximum solar-like oscillation power, {$\nu$}max. In this paper, we derive the basic method and demonstrate its ability to detect the pulsational power excesses from the well-studied APOKASC-2 sample of oscillating red giants observed by Kepler. We recover the catalogued {$\nu$}max values with an average precision of 2.7 per cent for 99.4 per cent of the stars with 4 yr of Kepler photometry. Our method produces false positives for {$<$} 1 per cent of dwarf stars with {$\nu$}max well above the long-cadence Nyquist frequency. The algorithm also flags spectra that exhibit astrophysically interesting signals in addition to single solar-like oscillation power excesses, which we catalogue as part of our characterization of the Kepler light curves of APOKASC-2 targets.},

Nine of these stars had incorrect or unknown periods in the literature. 14 of the stars exhibit both amplitude and phase Blazhko modulations, with Blazhko periods ranging from 27.7 to more than 200 d. For V445 Lyr, a longer secondary variation is also observed in addition to its 53.2-d Blazhko period. The unprecedented precision of the Kepler photometry has led to the discovery of the the smallest modulations detected so far. Moreover, additional frequencies beyond the well-known harmonics and Blazhko multiplets have been found. These frequencies are located around the half-integer multiples of the main pulsation frequency for at least three stars. In four stars, these frequencies are close to the first and/or second overtone modes. The amplitudes of these periodicities seem to vary over the Blazhko cycle. V350 Lyr, a non-Blazhko star in our sample, is the first example of a double-mode RR Lyrae star that pulsates in its fundamental and second overtone modes.},

(iii) The presence of the Blazhko effect was carefully checked and identified one new Blazhko candidate but for at least 16 stars the effect can be excluded. This fact has important consequences. Either the cycle-to-cycle variation phenomenon is independent from the Blazhko effect and the Blazhko incidence ratio is still much lower (51\%-55\%) than the extremely large ({$>$}90\%) ratio published recently. The connection between the extra modes and the cycle-to-cycle variations is marginal.},

Mixed modes can also place stringent constraints on the physics of such stars and on their global properties (mass, age, etc.). Here, using two Kepler stars (KIC 4351319 and KIC 6442183), we demonstrate that measurements of mixed mode characteristics allow us to estimate the mode inertias, providing a new and additional diagnostics on the mode trapping and subsequently on the internal structure of evolved stars.

  abstract = {Oscillation properties are usually measured by fitting symmetric Lorentzian profiles to the power spectra of Sunlike stars. However, the line profiles of solar oscillations have been observed to be asymmetrical for the Sun. The physical origin of this line asymmetry is not fully understood; though, it should depend on the depth dependence of the source of wave excitation (convective turbulence) and details of the observable (velocity or intensity). For oscillations of the Sun, it has been shown that neglecting the asymmetry leads to systematic errors in the frequency determination. This could subsequently affect the results of seismic inferences of the solar internal structure. Using light curves from the Kepler spacecraft, we have measured mode asymmetries in 43 stars. We confirm that neglecting the asymmetry leads to systematic errors that can exceed the 1{$\sigma$} confidence intervals for seismic observations longer than one year. Therefore, the application of an asymmetric Lorentzian profile should be favored to improve the accuracy of the internal stellar structure and stellar fundamental parameters. We also show that the asymmetry changes sign between cool Sun-like stars and hotter stars. This provides the best constraints to date on the location of the excitation sources across the Hertzsprung\textendash Russel diagram.},

The determination of {$\psi$} requires the independent estimates of the inclination angles of the stellar spin axis and of the planetary orbital axis with respect to the line of sight, i and iorb, and the projection of the spin\textendash orbit angle on to the plane of the sky, {$\lambda$}. These are mainly derived from asteroseismology, transit lightcurve, and the Rossiter\textendash McLaughlin effect, respectively. The detailed joint analysis of those three datasets enables an accurate and precise determination of the numerous parameters characterizing the planetary system, in addition to {$\psi$}. We demonstrate the power of the joint analysis for the two specific systems HAT-P-7 and Kepler-25. HAT-P-7b is the first exoplanet suspected to be a retrograde (or polar) planet because of the significant misalignment {$\lambda$} {$\approx$} 180{$\smwhtcircle$}. Our joint analysis indicates i {$\approx$} 30{$\smwhtcircle$} and {$\psi$} {$\approx$} 120{$\smwhtcircle$}, suggesting that the planetary orbit is closer to polar rather than retrograde. Kepler-25 is one of the few multi-transiting planetary systems with measured {$\lambda$}, and hosts two short-period transiting planets and one outer non-transiting planet. The projected spin\textendash orbit angle of the larger transiting planet, Kepler-25c, has been measured to be {$\lambda$} {$\approx$} 0{$\smwhtcircle$}, implying that the system is well aligned. With the help of the tight constraint from asteroseismology, however, we obtain i = 65{$\smwhtcircle$}.4+-160{$\smwhtcircle$}. 4{$\smwhtcircle$}. 6 and {$\psi$} = 26{$\smwhtcircle$}. 9+-79 {$\smwhtcircle$}.},

Here, we measure the characteristics of the mixed modes, particularly the coupling strength, using a grid of stellar models for stars with masses between 0.9 and 1.5 M . We show that the coupling strength of the = 1 mixed modes is predominantly a function of stellar mass and appears to be independent of metallicity. This should allow an accurate mass evaluation, further increasing the usefulness of mixed modes in subgiants as asteroseismic tools.},

It is found that the difference between the surface rotation rate and the average rotation rate (excluding the convective core) of most of stars is small enough to suggest that an efficient process of angular momentum transport operates during and/or before the main-sequence stage of stars. If each of the surface convective zone and the underlying radiative zone, for individual stars, is assumed to rotate uniformly, the difference in the rotation rate between the two zones turns out to be no more than a factor of 2 in most of the stars independently of their ages.},

We detect 86 sources within 8' of the cluster center, including 59 inside the half-mass radius. We identify 20 sources with proper-motion cluster members, which are a mix of cataclysmic variables (CVs), active binaries (ABs), and binaries containing sub-subgiants. With follow-up optical spectroscopy, we confirm the nature of one CV. We discover one new, X-ray variable candidate CV with Balmer and He II emission lines in its optical spectrum; this is the first X-ray-selected CV in an open cluster. The number of CVs per unit mass is consistent with the field, suggesting that the 3-4 CVs observed in NGC 6791 are primordial. We compare the X-ray properties of NGC 6791 with those of a few old open (NGC 6819, M 67) and globular clusters (47 Tuc, NGC 6397). It is puzzling that the number of ABs brighter than 1 \texttimes{} 10 30 erg s \textendash 1 normalized by cluster mass is lower in NGC 6791 than in M 67 by a factor 3-7. CVs, ABs, and sub-subgiants brighter than 1 \texttimes{} 10 30 erg s \textendash 1 are under-represented per unit mass in the globular clusters compared to the oldest open clusters, and this accounts for the lower total X-ray luminosity per unit mass of the former. This indicates that the net effect of dynamical encounters may be the destruction of even some of the hardest (i.e., X-ray-emitting) binaries.},

  abstract = {One bottleneck for the exploitation of data from the Kepler mission for stellar astrophysics and exoplanet research has been the lack of precise radii and evolutionary states for most of the observed stars. We report revised radii of 177,911 Kepler stars derived by combining parallaxes from the Gaia Data Release 2 with the DR25 Kepler Stellar Properties Catalog. The median radius precision is {$\approx$}8\%, a typical improvement by a factor of 4\textendash 5 over previous estimates for typical Kepler stars. We find that {$\approx$}67\% ({$\approx$}120,000) of all Kepler targets are main-sequence stars, {$\approx$}21\% ({$\approx$}37,000) are subgiants, and {$\approx$}12\% ({$\approx$}21,000) are red giants, demonstrating that subgiant contamination is less severe than some previous estimates and that Kepler targets are mostly main-sequence stars. Using the revised stellar radii, we recalculate the radii for 2123 confirmed and 1922 candidate exoplanets. We confirm the presence of a gap in the radius distribution of small, close-in planets, but find that the gap is mostly limited to incident fluxes {$>$}200 F\AA, and its location may be at a slightly larger radius (closer to {$\approx$}2 R{$\oplus$}) when compared to previous results. Furthermore, we find several confirmed exoplanets occupying a previously described ``hot super-Earth desert'' at high irradiance, show the relation between a gas-giant planet's radius and its incident flux, and establish a bona fide sample of eight confirmed planets and 30 planet candidates with Rp {$<$} 2 R{$\oplus$} in circumstellar ``habitable zones'' (incident fluxes between 0.25 and 1.50 F\AA ). The results presented here demonstrate the potential for transformative characterization of stellar and exoplanet populations using Gaia data.},

Although theoretically predicted more than 50 years ago, this core-flash phase has yet to be observationally probed. We show here that gravity modes (g modes) stochastically excited by He-flash driven convection are able to reach the stellar surface, and induce periodic photometric variabilities in hot-subdwarf stars with amplitudes of the order of a few mmag. As such they can now be detected by space-based photometry with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in relatively bright stars (e.g. magnitudes \$I\_C\textbackslash lesssim 13\$). The range of predicted periods spans from a few thousand seconds to tens of thousand seconds, depending on the details of the excitation region. In addition, we find that stochastically excited pulsations reproduce the pulsations observed in a couple of He-rich hot subdwarf stars. These stars, and in particular the future TESS target Feige 46, are the most promising candidates to probe the He-core flash for the first time.},

The Galaxy is a luminous (L{$\star$}) barred spiral with a central box/peanut bulge, a dominant disk, and a diffuse stellar halo. Based on global properties, it falls in the sparsely populated ``green valley'' region of the galaxy color-magnitude diagram. Here we review the key integrated, structural and kinematic parameters of the Galaxy, and point to uncertainties as well as directions for future progress.

However, MCMC sampling can be prohibitively slow, and it is important to explore alternatives. One class of alternatives is provided by variational methods, a class of deterministic algorithms that convert inference problems into optimization problems (Opper and Saad, 2001; Wainwright and Jordan, 2003). Thus far, variational methods have mainly been explored in the parametric setting, in particular within the formalism of the exponential family (Attias, 2000; Ghahramani and Beal, 2001; Blei et al., 2003). In this paper, we present a variational inference algorithm for DP mixtures. We present experiments that compare the algorithm to Gibbs sampling algorithms for DP mixtures of Gaussians and present an application to a large-scale image analysis problem. 1 1},

  abstract = {The Kepler Mission has acquired 33.5 d of continuous 1-min photometry of KPD 1946+4340, a short-period binary system that consists of a subdwarf B star (sdB) and a white dwarf. In the light curve, eclipses are clearly seen, with the deepest occurring when the compact white dwarf crosses the disc of the sdB (0.4 per cent) and the more shallow ones (0.1 per cent) when the sdB eclipses the white dwarf. As expected, the sdB is deformed by the gravitational field of the white dwarf, which produces an ellipsoidal modulation of the light curve. Spectacularly, a very strong Doppler beaming (also known as Doppler boosting) effect is also clearly evident at the 0.1 per cent level. This originates from the sdB's orbital velocity, which we measure to be 164.0 {$\pm$} 1.9 km s-1 from supporting spectroscopy. We present light-curve models that account for all these effects, as well as gravitational lensing, which decreases the apparent radius of the white dwarf by about 6 per cent, when it eclipses the sdB. We derive system parameters and uncertainties from the light curve using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. Adopting a theoretical white dwarf mass\textendash radius relation, the mass of the subdwarf is found to be 0.47 {$\pm$} 0.03 M and the mass of the white dwarf 0.59 {$\pm$} 0.02 M . The effective temperature of the white dwarf is 15 900 {$\pm$} 300 K. With a spectroscopic effective temperature of Teff = 34 730 {$\pm$} 250 K and a surface gravity of log g = 5.43 {$\pm$} 0.04, the subdwarf has most likely exhausted its core helium, and is in a shell He burning stage.},

The spectra were taken as part of the validation process for the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline (SSPP) and released in the eighth SDSS data release. If there are star-to-star abundance variations present at a given evolutionary state in a stellar population, they may be observed through variations in the molecular band strengths at that stage. Characterizing these variations in globular clusters has shown that the band strengths form a bimodal distribution, indicative of cluster members with different chemical abundances and possibly multiple generations of stars. In this work, we use this technique on an open cluster (NGC 6791) to address the possibility of abundance variations present in the cluster. Performing this analysis on other open clusters has resulted in unimodal distributions of CN and CH band strengths, as expected from their typical physical characteristics. NGC 6791, however, provides an interesting case study for this analysis due to its high mass \textasciitilde 5 x 10 \textsubscript{4} solar masses, old age \textasciitilde{} 8 Gyr, and high metallicity [Fe/H] \textasciitilde{} +0.4 dex, making it a less than typical open cluster. For this reason, NGC 6791 has been the subject of other studies (see Twarog, et al. 2011; Geisler, et al. 2012; Carrera, 2012) focused on detecting abundance variations in the cluster using broadband photometry, high resolution spectra, and molecular band strengths. These studies have found some evidence for abundance variations among the cluster members, but there is still debate as to whether these findings are conclusive. In this study, we do not find evidence to support abundance variations between cluster members of NGC 6791.},

  abstract = {Stellar evolution and Galactic evolution have both been greatly advanced by the study of star clusters. In addition the elemental abundance results from clusters have revealed information about Galactic chemical evolution and nucleosynthesis. The cluster, NGC 6791, has a number of bizarre properties that make it especially interesting for comparative cluster studies. It is old (8.3 Gyr) yet metal-rich ([Fe/H] = +0.30). It has a heliocentric distance of 4 kpc and a galactic latitude of +11 degrees which makes it 1 kpc above the galactic plane. Its boxy orbit has a high eccentricity (\textasciitilde 0.5) with a perigalactic distance of 3 kpc and an apogalactic distance of 10 kpc. The orbital period of \textasciitilde 130 Myr indicates that it has crossed the Galactic plane several times yet has remained as an intact cluster. We have determined abundances from high-resolution (R = 46,000) Keck/HIRES spectra of turn-off stars in this open cluster NGC 6791. We have a solid determination of [Fe/H] = +0.30 +/-0.02 from measurements of some 40 unblended, unsaturated lines of both Fe I and Fe II in eight turn-off stars. Our O abundances come from the O I triplet near 7774 \AA{} and are corrected for small nLTE effects. We find consistent ratios of [O/Fe]n with a mean of -0.06 +/-0.02, indicating a single population of stars. Our results for the alpha elements [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] are near solar and compare well with those of old, metal-rich field stars. The Fe-peak elements, Cr and Ni, have values of [Cr/Fe] = +0.05 +/-0.02 and [Ni/Fe] = +0.04 +/-0.01. Determinations of upper limits were found for Li by spectrum synthesis; this is consistent with the upper limits in this temperature range for turn-off/subgiant stars in the relatively old, super-metal-rich cluster NGC 6253. We speculate that no stars in NGC 6791 have retained the Li with which they formed.},

  abstract = {Stellar models generally use simple parameterizations to treat convection. The most widely used parameterization is the so-called mixing-length theory where the convective eddy sizes are described using a single number, {$\alpha$}, the mixing-length parameter. This is a free parameter, and the general practice is to calibrate {$\alpha$} using the known properties of the Sun and apply that to all stars. Using data from NASA's Kepler mission we show that using the solar-calibrated {$\alpha$} is not always appropriate, and that in many cases it would lead to estimates of initial helium abundances that are lower than the primordial helium abundance. Kepler data allow us to calibrate {$\alpha$} for many other stars and we show that for the sample of stars we have studied, the mixing-length parameter is generally lower than the solar value. We studied the correlation between {$\alpha$} and stellar properties, and we find that {$\alpha$} increases with metallicity. We therefore conclude that results obtained by fitting stellar models or by using population-synthesis models constructed with solar values of {$\alpha$} are likely to have large systematic errors. Our results also confirm theoretical expectations that the mixing-length parameter should vary with stellar properties.},

Results. We demonstrate the presence of a clear correlation between the Mt. Wilson S index and the relative age of the stars as indicated by the small frequency separation, as well as an anti-correlation between the S index and the oscillation amplitudes. We argue that the average activity level of the stars shows a stronger correlation with the small frequency separation than with the absolute age that is often considered in the literature. Conclusions. The phenomenological laws discovered in this paper have the potential to become new important diagnostics to link stellar evolution theory with the dynamics of global magnetic fields. In particular we argue that the relation between the Mt. Wilson S index and the oscillation amplitudes is in good agreement with the findings of direct numerical simulations of magneto-convection.},

  abstract = {We present a simple approach for obtaining robust values of astrophysical parameters from the observed colour\textendash magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of star clusters. The basic inputs are the Hess diagram built with the photometric measurements of a star cluster and a set of isochrones covering wide ranges of age and metallicity. In short, each isochrone is shifted in apparent distance modulus and colour excess until it crosses over the maximum possible Hess density. Repeating this step for all available isochrones leads to the construction of the solution map, in which the optimum values of age and metallicity \textendash{} as well as foreground/background reddening and distance from the Sun \textendash{} can be searched for. Controlled tests with simulated CMDs show that the approach is efficient in recovering the input values. We apply the approach to the open clusters M 67, NGC 6791 and NGC 2635, which are characterized by different ages, metallicities and distances from the Sun.},

  abstract = {HD 181068 is the brighter of the two known triply eclipsing hierarchical triple stars in the Kepler field. It has been continuously observed for more than 2 yr with the Kepler space telescope. Of the nine quarters of the data, three have been obtained in short-cadence mode, that is one point per 58.9 s. Here we analyse this unique data set to determine absolute physical parameters (most importantly the masses and radii) and full orbital configuration using a sophisticated novel approach. We measure eclipse timing variations (ETVs), which are then combined with the single-lined radial velocity measurements to yield masses in a manner equivalent to double-lined spectroscopic binaries. We have also developed a new light-curve synthesis code that is used to model the triple, mutual eclipses and the effects of the changing tidal field on the stellar surface and the relativistic Doppler beaming. By combining the stellar masses from the ETV study with the simultaneous light-curve analysis we determine the absolute radii of the three stars. Our results indicate that the close and the wide subsystems revolve in almost exactly coplanar and prograde orbits. The newly determined parameters draw a consistent picture of the system with such details that have been beyond reach before.},

Here we give the identity and characteristics of 305 released stars with planetary candidates. Data for the remaining 400 stars with planetary candidates will be released in 2011 February. More than half the candidates on the released list have radii less than half that of Jupiter. Five candidates are present in and near the habitable zone; two near super-Earth size, and three bracketing the size of Jupiter. The released stars also include five possible multi-planet systems. One of these has two Neptune-size (2.3 and 2.5 Earth radius) candidates with near-resonant periods.},

There are 1235 planetary candidates with transit-like signatures detected in this period. These are associated with 997 host stars. Distributions of the characteristics of the planetary candidates are separated into five class sizes: 68 candidates of approximately Earth-size (Rp {$<$} 1.25 R{$\oplus$}), 288 superEarth-size (1.25 R{$\oplus$} Rp {$<$} 2 R{$\oplus$}), 662 Neptune-size (2 R{$\oplus$} Rp {$<$} 6 R{$\oplus$}), 165 Jupiter-size (6 R{$\oplus$} Rp {$<$} 15 R{$\oplus$}), and 19 up to twice the size of Jupiter (15 R{$\oplus$} Rp {$<$} 22 R{$\oplus$}). In the temperature range appropriate for the habitable zone, 54 candidates are found with sizes ranging from Earth-size to larger than that of Jupiter. Six are less than twice the size of the Earth. Over 74\% of the planetary candidates are smaller than Neptune. The observed number versus size distribution of planetary candidates increases to a peak at two to three times the Earth-size and then declines inversely proportional to the area of the candidate. Our current best estimates of the intrinsic frequencies of planetary candidates, after correcting for geometric and sensitivity biases, are 5\% for Earth-size candidates, 8\% for super-Earth-size candidates, 18\% for Neptune-size candidates, 2\% for Jupiter-size candidates, and 0.1\% for very large candidates; a total of 0.34 candidates per star. Multi-candidate, transiting systems are frequent; 17\% of the host stars have multi-candidate systems, and 34\% of all the candidates are part of multi-candidate systems.},

The planet has an orbital period of 3.213 days and shows transits with a relative depth of 0.87 \texttimes{} 10-3 and a duration of about 3.95 hr. Radial velocity (RV) measurements from the Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer show a reflex Doppler signal of 9.3+-11..19 m s-1, consistent with a low-eccentricity orbit with the phase expected from the transits. Various tests show no evidence for any companion star near enough to affect the light curve or the RVs for this system. From a transit-based estimate of the host star's mean density, combined with analysis of high-resolution spectra, we infer that the host star is near turnoff from the main sequence, with estimated mass and radius of 1.223+-00..005931 M and 1.487+-00..007814 R . We estimate the planet mass and radius to be \{MP, RP\} = \{24.5 {$\pm$} 3.8 M{$\oplus$}, 3.99 {$\pm$} 0.21 R{$\oplus\rbrace$}. The planet's density is near 1.9 g cm-3; it is thus slightly denser and more massive than Neptune, but about the same size.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {Convective mixing in helium-core-burning (HeCB) stars is one of the outstanding issues in stellar modelling. The precise asteroseismic measurements of gravity-mode period spacing ( 1) have opened the door to detailed studies of the near-core structure of such stars, which had not been possible before. Here, we provide stringent tests of various core-mixing scenarios against the largely unbiased population of red-clump stars belonging to the old-open clusters monitored by Kepler, and by coupling the updated precise inference on 1 in thousands of field stars with spectroscopic constraints. We find that models with moderate overshooting successfully reproduce the range observed of 1 in clusters. In particular, we show that there is no evidence for the need to extend the size of the adiabatically stratified core, at least at the beginning of the HeCB phase. This conclusion is based primarily on ensemble studies of 1 as a function of mass and metallicity. While 1 shows no appreciable dependence on the mass, we have found a clear dependence of 1 on metallicity, which is also supported by predictions from models.},

The reddening and metallicity of the cluster were determined by independent methods. The LAMOST spectra and the ultraviolet excess of the F- and G-type main-sequence stars in the cluster indicate that the metallicity of the cluster is about the solar value.

  abstract = {Determining the level of chemical homogeneity in open clusters is of fundamental importance in the study of the evolution of star-forming clouds and that of the Galactic disk. Yet limiting the initial abundance spread in clusters has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining consistent spectroscopic abundances for different stellar types. Without reference to any specific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a homogeneous cluster is that it forms a one-dimensional sequence, with any differences between members due to variations in stellar mass and observational uncertainties. I present a novel method for investigating the abundance spread in open clusters that tests this one-dimensional hypothesis at the level of observed stellar spectra, rather than constraining homogeneity using derived abundances as is traditionally done. Using high-resolution APOGEE spectra for 49 giants in M67, NGC 6819, and NGC 2420 I demonstrate that these spectra form one-dimensional sequences for each cluster. With detailed forward modeling of the spectra and Approximate Bayesian Computation, I derive strong limits on the initial abundance spread of 15 elements: {$<$}0.01 (0.02) dex for C and Fe, 0.015 (0.03) dex for N, O, Mg, Si, and Ni, 0.02 (0.03) dex for Al, Ca, and Mn, and 0.03 (0.05) dex for Na, S, K, Ti, and V (at 68\% and 95\% confidence, respectively). The strong limits on C and O imply that no pollution by massive core-collapse supernovae occurred during star formation in open clusters, which, thus, need to form within 6 Myr. Further development of this and related techniques will bring the power of differential abundances to stars other than solar twins in large spectroscopic surveys and will help unravel the history of star formation and chemical enrichment in the Milky Way through chemical tagging.},

We demonstrate the diversity in pulsational behaviour observed, in particular non-linearity, which is predicted for {$\delta$} Sct stars. We analyse and discuss examples of {$\delta$} Sct stars with constant amplitudes and phases; those that exhibit amplitude modulation caused by beating of closefrequency pulsation modes; those that exhibit pure amplitude modulation (with no associated phase variation); those that exhibit phase modulation caused by binarity; and those that exhibit amplitude modulation caused by non-linearity. Using models and examples of individual stars, we demonstrate that observations of the changes in amplitude and phase of pulsation modes can be used to distinguish among the different scenarios. We find that 603 {$\delta$} Sct stars (61.3 per cent) exhibit at least one pulsation mode that varies significantly in amplitude over 4 yr. Conversely, many {$\delta$} Sct stars have constant pulsation amplitudes so short-length observations can be used to determine precise frequencies, amplitudes and phases for the most coherent and periodic {$\delta$} Sct stars. It is shown that amplitude modulation is not restricted to a small region on the HR diagram, therefore not necessarily dependent on stellar parameters such as Teff or log g. Our catalogue of 983 {$\delta$} Sct stars will be useful for comparisons to similar stars observed by K2 and TESS, because the length of the 4-yr Kepler data set will not be surpassed for some time.},

  abstract = {The {$\delta$} Sct stars are a diverse group of intermediate-mass pulsating stars located on and near the main sequence within the classical instability strip in the Hertzsprung\textendash Russell diagram. Many of these stars are hybrid stars pulsating simultaneously with pressure and gravity modes that probe the physics at different depths within a star's interior. Using two large ensembles of {$\delta$} Sct stars observed by the Kepler Space Telescope, the instrumental biases inherent to Kepler mission data and the statistical properties of these stars are investigated. An important focus of this work is an analysis of the relationships between the pulsational and stellar parameters, and their distribution within the classical instability strip. It is found that a non-negligible fraction of main-sequence {$\delta$} Sct stars exist outside theoretical predictions of the classical instability boundaries, which indicates the necessity of a mass-dependent mixing length parameter to simultaneously explain low and high radial order pressure modes in {$\delta$} Sct stars within the Hertzsprung\textendash Russell diagram. Furthermore, a search for regularities in the amplitude spectra of these stars is also presented, specifically the frequency difference between pressure modes of consecutive radial order. In this work, it is demonstrated that an ensemble-based approach using space photometry from the Kepler mission is not only plausible for {$\delta$} Sct stars, but that it is a valuable method for identifying the most promising stars for mode identification and asteroseismic modelling. The full scientific potential of studying {$\delta$} Sct stars is as yet unrealized. The ensembles discussed in this paper represent a high-quality data set for future studies of rotation and angular momentum transport inside A and F stars using asteroseismology.},

The Kepler data set was divided into a series with time bins of equal length for which consecutive Fourier transforms were calculated. An optimum fixed frequency, calculated from a least-squares fit of all data, allowed amplitude and phase of each pulsation mode for each time bin to be tracked. The single pressure mode at {$\nu$} = 13.3942 d-1 changed significantly in amplitude, from 5.16 {$\pm$} 0.03 to 0.53 {$\pm$} 0.06 mmag, but also varied quasi-sinusoidally in phase, with a characteristic period similar to the length of the data set. All other p and g modes were stable in both amplitude and phase, which is clear evidence that the visible pulsation mode energy is not conserved within this star. Possible causes of the observed amplitude and phase modulation and the missing mode energy are discussed.},

The spectra were analyzed using both equivalent widths measured with an automatic procedure and comparisons with synthetic spectra.

However, the transition between them is not easily defined because there is some overlap between high-mass, old OCs and low-mass, young GCs. We are exploring the possibility of a clear-cut separation between OCs and GCs using an abundance feature that has been found so far only in GCs: (anti)correlations between light elements. Among the coupled abundance trends, the Na-O anticorrelation is the most widely studied. These anticorrelations are the signature of self-enrichment, i.e., of a formation mechanism that implies multiple generations of stars. Here we concentrate on the old, massive, metal-rich OC NGC 6791. We analyzed archival Keck/HIRES spectra of 15 NGC 6791 main-sequence turnoff and evolved stars, concentrating on the derivation of C, N, O, and Na abundances. We also used WIYN/Hydra spectra of 21 evolved stars (one is in common). Given the spectral complexity of the very metal-rich NGC 6791 stars, we employed spectrum synthesis to measure most of the abundances. We confirmed the cluster super-solar metallicity and abundances of Ca and Ni that have been derived in past studies. More importantly, we did not detect any significant star-to-star abundance dispersion in C, N, O, and Na. Based on the absence of a clear Na-O anticorrelation, NGC 6791 can still be considered a true OC, hosting a single generation of stars and not a low-mass GC.},

  abstract = {In the faint star KIC 9700322 observed by the Kepler satellite, 76 frequencies with amplitudes from 14 to 29 000 ppm were detected. The two dominant frequencies at 9.79 and 12.57 d-1 (113.3 and 145.5 \textmu Hz), interpreted to be radial modes, are accompanied by a large number of combination frequencies. A small additional modulation with a 0.16 d-1 frequency is also seen; this is interpreted to be the rotation frequency of the star. The corresponding prediction of slow rotation is confirmed by a spectrum from which v sin i = 19 {$\pm$} 1 km s-1 is obtained. The analysis of the spectrum shows that the star is one of the coolest {$\delta$} Sct variables. We also determine Teff = 6700 {$\pm$} 100 K and log g = 3.7 {$\pm$} 0.1, compatible with the observed frequencies of the radial modes. Normal solar abundances are found. An = 2 frequency quintuplet is also detected with a frequency separation consistent with predictions from the measured rotation rate. A remarkable result is the absence of additional independent frequencies down to an amplitude limit near 14 ppm, suggesting that the star is stable against most forms of non-radial pulsation. A low-frequency peak at 2.7763 d-1 in KIC 9700322 is the frequency difference between the two dominant modes and is repeated over and over in various frequency combinations involving the two dominant modes. The relative phases of the combination frequencies show a strong correlation with frequency, but the physical significance of this result is not clear.},

  abstract = {Two years of Kepler data of KIC 8054146 ({$\delta$} Sct/{$\gamma$} Dor hybrid) revealed 349 statistically significant frequencies between 0.54 and 191.36 cycles day-1 (6.3 {$\mu$}Hz to 2.21 mHz). The 117 low frequencies cluster in specific frequency bands, but do not show the equidistant period spacings predicted for gravity modes of successive radial order, n, and reported for at least one other hybrid pulsator. The four dominant low frequencies in the 2.8\textendash 3.0 cycles day-1 (32\textendash 35 {$\mu$}Hz) range show strong amplitude variability with timescales of months and years. These four low frequencies also determine the spacing of the higher frequencies in and beyond the {$\delta$} Sct pressuremode frequency domain. In fact, most of the higher frequencies belong to one of three families with spacings linked to a specific dominant low frequency. In the Fourier spectrum, these family regularities show up as triplets, high-frequency sequences with absolutely equidistant frequency spacings, side lobes (amplitude modulations), and other regularities in frequency spacings. Furthermore, within two families the amplitude variations between the low and high frequencies are related. We conclude that the low frequencies (gravity modes, rotation) and observed high frequencies (mostly pressure modes) are physically connected. This unusual behavior may be related to the very rapid rotation of the star: from a combination of high- and low-resolution spectroscopy we determined that KIC 8054146 is a very fast rotator ({$\upsilon$} sin i = 300 {$\pm$} 20 km s-1) with an effective temperature of 7600 {$\pm$} 200 K and a surface gravity log g of 3.9 {$\pm$} 0.3. Several astrophysical ideas explaining the origin of the relationship between the low and high frequencies are explored.},

Here we are interested in measuring surface rotation periods of solar-like stars observed by the NASA Kepler mission. Different methods have been developed to track rotation signals in Kepler photometric light curves: time-frequency analysis based on wavelet techniques, autocorrelation and composite spectrum. We use the learning abilities of random forest classifiers to take decisions during two crucial steps of the analysis. First, given some input parameters, we discriminate the considered Kepler targets between rotating MS stars, non-rotating MS stars, red giants, binaries and pulsators. We then use a second classifier only on the MS rotating targets to decide the best data-analysis treatment.},

  abstract = {As part of our study of the old (\textasciitilde 2.5 Gyr) open cluster NGC 6819 in the Kepler field, we present photometric (Kepler and ground-based BVRcIc) and spectroscopic observations of the detached eclipsing binary WOCS 24009 (Auner 665; KIC 5023948) with a short orbital period of 3.6 days. WOCS 24009 is a triple-lined system, and we verify that the brightest star is physically orbiting the eclipsing binary using radial velocities and eclipse timing variations. The eclipsing binary components have masses M\_B =1.090+/-0.010 Msun and M\_C =1.075+/-0.013 Msun, and radii R\_B =1.095+/-0.007 Rsun and R\_C =1.057+/-0.008 Rsun. The bright non-eclipsing star resides at the cluster turnoff, and ultimately its mass will directly constrain the turnoff mass: our preliminary determination is M\_A =1.251+/-0.057 Msun. A careful examination of the light curves indicates that the fainter star in the eclipsing binary undergoes a very brief period of total eclipse, which enables us to precisely decompose the light of the three stars and place them in the color-magnitude diagram. We also present improved analysis of two previously discussed detached eclipsing stars in NGC 6819 (WOCS 40007 and WOCS 23009) en route to a combined determination of the cluster's distance modulus (m-M)\_V=12.38+/-0.04. Because this paper significantly increases the number of measured stars in the cluster, we can better constrain the age of the color-magnitude diagram to be 2.21+/-0.10+/-0.20 Gyr. Additionally, using all measured eclipsing binary star masses and radii, we constrain the age to 2.38+/-0.05+/-0.22 Gyr. The quoted uncertainties are estimates of measurement and systematic uncertainties (due to model physics differences and metal content), respectively.},

The results reported herein span a little over half a square degree in the dark clouds L1495, L1529, L1551, and B209. Our survey is complete down to IC {$\sim$} 19 at (R - I)C {$\sim$} 2.5, which enables us to probe well below the hydrogen burning limit at 1\textendash 2 Myr. From follow-up spectroscopic observations we have identified nine new low-mass T Tauri stars (TTSs). A large fraction of the new PMS objects (5/9) have very low masses as inferred from their late spectral types ({$\geq$}M5), and comparison with recent evolutionary tracks and Pleiades brown dwarfs suggests that our M6\textendash M6.5 new TTSs are very young brown dwarfs. Two of the new TTSs may constitute a new, moderately embedded, binary classical T Tauri system. The new young stars represent a {$\sim$}38\% increase in the known PMS population of our survey area and a factor of {$\sim$}2 increase in the number of known late-type TTSs. In spite of our sensitivity, we detect no young stars with spectral types later than {$\sim$}M7. Our results illustrate the importance of spectroscopy in eliminating foreground M stars.},

Stellar rotation of main-sequence F-type stars can be characterized by two distinct rotational regimes. Early-type F-stars are usually rapid rotators with periods typically below 10 d, whereas later-type F-stars have longer rotation periods. Specifically, and since the two rotational regimes are tightly connected to the effective temperatures of the stars, we investigate in detail the characteristics of the partial ionization zones in the outer convective envelopes of these stars, which in turn, depend on the internal temperature profiles. Our study shows that the two rotational regimes might be distinguished by the relative locations of the partial ionization region of heavy elements and the base of the convective zone. Since in all these stars is expected a dynamo-driven magnetic field where the shear layer between convective and radiative zones (tachocline) plays an important role, this result suggests that the magnetic field may be related to the combined properties of convection and ionization.},

The latter is shown to be a powerful probe of the external stellar layers since it is particularly sensitive to the partial ionization zones located in these upper layers. We found that these theoretical envelopes can be organized into two groups, each of which is characterized by a distinct b (w) shape that we show to reflect the differences related to the magnitudes of ionization processes. Since b (w) can also be determined from the experimental frequencies, we compared our theoretical results with the observable b (w). Using the function b (w), and with the purpose of quantifying the magnitude of the ionization processes occurring in the outer layers of these stars, we define two indexes, Db1 and Db2. These indexes allow us to connect the microphysics of the interior of the star with macroscopic observable characteristics. Motivated by the distinct magnetic activity behaviors of F-stars, we studied the relation between the star's rotation period and these indexes. We found a trend, in the form of a power-law dependence, that favors the idea that ionization is acting as an underlying mechanism, which is crucial for understanding the relation between rotation and magnetism and even observational features such as the Kraft break.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} Models of stellar structure and evolution can be constrained by measuring accurate parameters of detached eclipsing binaries in open clusters. Multiple binary stars provide the means to determine helium abundances in these old stellar systems, and in turn, to improve estimates of their age. \emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} In the first paper of this series, we demonstrated how measurements of multiple eclipsing binaries in the old open cluster NGC 6791 sets tighter constraints on the properties of stellar models than has previously been possible, thereby potentially improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age. Here we add additional constraints and perform an extensive model comparison to determine the best estimates of the cluster age and helium content, employing as many observational constraints as possible. \emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We improve our photometry and correct empirically for differential reddening effects. We then perform an extensive comparison of the new colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and eclipsing binary measurements to Victoria and DSEP isochrones in order to estimate cluster parameters. We also reanalyse a spectrum of the star 2\textendash 17 to improve [Fe/H] constraints. \emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find a best estimate of the age of \textasciitilde 8.3 Gyr for NGC 6791 while demonstrating that remaining age uncertainty is dominated by uncertainties in the CNO abundances. The helium mass fraction is well constrained at \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$} = 0.30{$\pm$}0.01 resulting in {$\Delta$}\emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}/{$\Delta$}\emph{Z{$<$}i/{$>$} \textasciitilde{} 1.4 assuming that such a relation exists. During the analysis we firmly identify blue straggler stars, including the star 2\textendash 17, and find indications for the presence of their evolved counterparts. Our analysis supports the RGB mass-loss found from asteroseismology and we determine precisely the absolute mass of stars on the lower RGB, \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{RGB{$<$}sub/{$>$} = 1.15{$\pm$}0.02 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}. This will be an important consistency check for the detailed asteroseismology of cluster stars.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$} Using multiple, detached eclipsing binaries for determining stellar cluster ages, it is now possible to constrain parameters of stellar models, notably the helium content, which were previously out of reach. By observing a suitable number of detached eclipsing binaries in several open clusters, it will be possible to calibrate the age-scale and the helium enrichment parameter {$\Delta$} \emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}/{$\Delta$} \emph{Z{$<$}i/{$>$}, and provide firm constraints that stellar models must reproduce.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {We determine the properties of the binary star V106 in the old open cluster NGC6791. We identify the system to be a blue straggler cluster member by using a combination of ground-based and Kepler photometry and multi-epoch spectroscopy. The properties of the primary component are found to be \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm p\}\textbackslash sim1.67 \textbackslash rm M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, more massive than the cluster turn-off, with \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm p\}\textbackslash sim1.91 \textbackslash rm R\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and \$T\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}=7110\textbackslash pm100\$ K. The secondary component is highly oversized and overluminous for its low mass with \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm s\}\textbackslash sim0.182 \textbackslash rm M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, \$R\_\{\textbackslash rm s\}\textbackslash sim0.864 \textbackslash rm R\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and \$T\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\}=6875\textbackslash pm200\$ K. We identify this secondary star as a bloated (proto) extremely low-mass helium white dwarf. These properties of V106 suggest that it represents a typical Algol-paradox system and that it evolved through a mass-transfer phase which provides insight into its past evolution. We present a detailed binary stellar evolution model for the formation of V106 using the MESA code and find that the mass-transfer phase only ceased about 40 Myr ago. Due to the short orbital period (P=1.4463 d) another mass-transfer phase is unavoidable once the current primary star evolves towards the red giant phase. We argue that V106 will evolve through a common-envelope phase within the next 100 Myr and merge to become a single over-massive giant. The high mass will make it appear young for its true age, which is revealed by the cluster properties. Therefore, V106 is potentially a prototype progenitor of old field giants masquerading as young.},

  abstract = {We aim to establish and improve the accuracy level of asteroseismic estimates of mass, radius, and age of giant stars. This can be achieved by measuring independent, accurate, and precise masses, radii, effective temperatures and metallicities of long period eclipsing binary stars with a red giant component that displays solar-like oscillations. We measured precise properties of the three eclipsing binary systems KIC 7037405, KIC 9540226, and KIC 9970396 and estimated their ages be 5.3 {$\pm$} 0.5, 3.1 {$\pm$} 0.6, and 4.8 {$\pm$} 0.5 Gyr. The measurements of the giant stars were compared to corresponding measurements of mass, radius, and age using asteroseismic scaling relations and grid modelling. We found that asteroseismic scaling relations without corrections to {$\nu$} systematically overestimate the masses of the three red giants by 11.7 per cent, 13.7 per cent, and 18.9 per cent, respectively. However, by applying theoretical correction factors f {$\nu$} according to Rodrigues et al. (2017), we reached general agreement between dynamical and asteroseismic mass estimates, and no indications of systematic differences at the precision level of the asteroseismic measurements. The larger sample investigated by Gaulme et al. (2016) showed a much more complicated situation, where some stars show agreement between the dynamical and corrected asteroseismic measures while others suggest significant overestimates of the asteroseismic measures. We found no simple explanation for this, but indications of several potential problems, some theoretical, others observational. Therefore, an extension of the present precision study to a larger sample of eclipsing systems is crucial for establishing and improving the accuracy of asteroseismology of giant stars.},

We examine this issue for giant stars by comparing classical measurements of detached eclipsing binary systems (dEBs) with asteroseismic measurements from the Kepler mission. For star clusters, we extrapolate measurements of dEBs in the turn-off region to the red giant branch and the red clump where we investigate the giants as an ensemble. For the field stars, we measure dEBs with an oscillating giant component. These measurements allow a comparison of masses and radii calculated from a classical eclipsing binary analysis to those calculated from asteroseismic scaling relations and/or other asteroseismic methods. Our first results indicate small but significant systematic differences between the classical and asteroseismic measurements. In this contribution we show our latest results and summarize the current status and future plans. We also stress the importance of realizing that for giant stars mass cannot always be translated to age, since an unknown fraction of these evolved through a blue straggler phase with mass transfer in a binary system. Rough estimates of how many such stars to expect are given based on our findings in the open clusters NGC 6819 and NGC 6791.},

  abstract = {Regions of rapid variation in the internal structure of a star are often referred to as acoustic glitches since they create a characteristic periodic signature in the frequencies of p modes. Here we examine the localized disturbance arising from the helium second ionization zone in red giant branch and clump stars. More specifically, we determine how accurately and precisely the parameters of the ionization zone can be obtained from the oscillation frequencies of stellar models. We use models produced by three different generation codes that not only cover a wide range of stages of evolution along the red giant phase but also incorporate different initial helium abundances. To study the acoustic glitch caused by the second ionization zone of helium we have determined the second differences in frequencies of modes with the same angular degree, l, and then we fit the periodic function described by Houdek \& Gough to the second differences. We discuss the conditions under which such fits robustly and accurately determine the acoustic radius of the second ionization zone of helium. When the frequency of maximum amplitude of the p-mode oscillations was greater than 40 \textmu Hz a robust value for the radius of the ionization zone was recovered for the majority of models. The determined radii of the ionization zones as inferred from the mode frequencies were found to be coincident with the local maximum in the first adiabatic exponent described by the models, which is associated with the outer edge of the second ionization zone of helium. Finally, we consider whether this method can be used to distinguish stars with different helium abundances. Although a definite trend in the amplitude of the signal is observed any distinction would be difficult unless the stars come from populations with vastly different helium abundances or the uncertainties associated with the fitted parameters can be reduced. However, application of our methodology could be useful for distinguishing between different populations of red giant stars in globular clusters, where distinct populations with very different helium abundances have been observed.},

The variations have frequencies within a 1.1 mHz range centered at 0.9 mHz, and a total rms amplitude within that range of 2.5 m/s. Observations of Arcturus and scattered sunlight made with the same equipment during the same time interval show no such variation, indicating that the variations seen on Procyon are of stellar origin. The Doppler signal seen is entirely consistent with solar-like p-modes on Procyon, with maximum mode amplitudes of about 50 cm/s and periods around 20 minutes. Several statistical tests support the identification for the signal with narrow-band oscillations, but none does so conclusively. Assuming that the signal does arise from p-modes, there is evidence that the frequency splitting nu(0) is 71 micro-Hz. The data do not permit a definite estimate of this quantity, and other values of nu(0) fit the observations about equally well. In order to clarify the sources of ambiguity in this and similar observations, the data acquisition, reduction, and interpretation are described.},

A series of binary population synthesis (BPS) simulations have been carried out in order to see if binary interactions can produce a fuller HB population, especially EHB (extreme horizontal branch) stars, that canonical models fail to reproduce. In particular, the Han binary population synthesis code (Han 2000), together with results from BPS studies of the formation channels of sdB/EHb stars (Han et al. 2002, 2003) from common envelope (CE), stable Roche Lobe Overflow (RLOF), and WD merger events, are applied to NGC 6791.

The KIC is a catalog containing photometric and physical data for sources in the Kepler mission field of view; it is used by the mission to select optimal targets. Four of the visible-light (g, r, i, z) magnitudes used in the KIC are tied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey magnitudes; the fifth (D51) is an AB magnitude calibrated to be consistent with Castelli \& Kurucz (CK) model atmosphere fluxes. We derived atmospheric extinction corrections from hourly observations of secondary standard fields within the Kepler field of view. For these filters and extinction estimates, repeatability of absolute photometry for stars brighter than magnitude 15 is typically 2\%. We estimated stellar parameters \{Teff, log(g), log(Z), EB-V \} using Bayesian posterior probability maximization to match observed colors to CK stellar atmosphere models. We applied Bayesian priors describing the distribution of solar-neighborhood stars in the color\textendash magnitude diagram, in log(Z), and in height above the galactic plane. Several comparisons with samples of stars classified by other means indicate that for 4500 K Teff 6500 K, our classifications are reliable within about {$\pm$}200 K and 0.4 dex in log(g) for dwarfs, with somewhat larger log(g) uncertainties for giants. It is difficult to assess the reliability of our log(Z) estimates, but there is reason to suspect that it is poor, particularly at extreme Teff. Comparisons between the CK models and observed colors are generally satisfactory with some exceptions, notably for stars cooler than 4500 K. Of great importance for the Kepler mission, for Teff 5400 K, comparison with asteroseismic results shows that the distinction between main-sequence stars and giants is reliable with about 98\% confidence. Larger errors in log(g) occur for warmer stars, for which our filter set provides inadequate gravity diagnostics. The KIC is available through the MAST data archive.},

  abstract = {We combine results from interferometry, asteroseismology and spectroscopy to determine accurate fundamental parameters of 23 bright solar-type stars, from spectral type F5 to K2 and luminosity classes III-V. For some stars we can use direct techniques to determine the mass, radius, luminosity and effective temperature, and we compare with indirect methods that rely on photometric calibrations or spectroscopic analyses. We use the asteroseismic information available in the literature to infer an indirect mass with an accuracy of 4-15 per cent. From indirect methods we determine luminosity and radius to 3 per cent. We find evidence that the luminosity from the indirect method is slightly overestimated ({$\approx$} 5 per cent) for the coolest stars, indicating that their bolometric corrections (BCs) are too negative. For T\textsubscript{eff} we find a slight offset of -40 {$\pm$} 20 K between the spectroscopic method and the direct method, meaning the spectroscopic temperatures are too high. From the spectroscopic analysis we determine the detailed chemical composition for 13 elements, including Li, C and O. The metallicity ranges from [Fe/H]=-1.7 to +0.4, and there is clear evidence for {$\alpha$}-element enhancement in the metal-poor stars. We find no significant offset between the spectroscopic surface gravity and the value from combining asteroseismology with radius estimates. From the spectroscopy we also determine v sin i and we present a new calibration of macroturbulence and microturbulence. From the comparison between the results from the direct and spectroscopic methods we claim that we can determine T\textsubscript{eff}, log g and [Fe/H] with absolute accuracies of 80 K, 0.08 and 0.07 dex. Photometric calibrations of Str\"omgren indices provide accurate results for T\textsubscript{eff} and [Fe/H] but will be more uncertain for distant stars when interstellar reddening becomes important. The indirect methods are important to obtain reliable estimates of the fundamental parameters of relatively faint stars when interferometry cannot be used. This paper is the first to compare direct and indirect methods for a large sample of stars, and we conclude that indirect methods are valid, although slight corrections may be needed.},

We applied the iterative spectral synthesis method VWA to derive the fundamental parameters from carefully selected high-quality iron lines and pressure-sensitive Calcium lines. Results. We find good agreement with parameters from the literature for the six bright giants. We compared the spectroscopic values with parameters based on photometric indices in the Kepler Input Catalogue (KIC). We identify serious problems with the KIC values for [Fe/H] and find a large RMS scatter of 0.5 dex. The log g values in KIC agree reasonably well with the spectroscopic values displaying a scatter of 0.25 dex after excluding two low-metallicity giants. The Teff values from VWA and KIC agree well with a scatter of about 85 K. We also find good agreement with log g and Teff derived from asteroseismic analyses for seven Kepler giant targets. Conclusions. We determine accurate fundamental parameters of 14 giants using spectroscopic data. The large discrepancies between photometric and spectroscopic values of [Fe/H] emphasize the need for further detailed spectroscopic follow-up of the Kepler targets. This will be mandatory to be able to produce reliable constraints for detailed asteroseismic analyses and interpretation of possible exo-planet candidates found around giant stars.},

  abstract = {Kepler seeks to detect sequences of transits of Earth-size exoplanets orbiting solar-like stars. Such transit signals are on the order of 100 ppm. The high photometric precision demanded by Kepler requires detailed knowledge of how the Kepler pixels respond to starlight during a nominal observation. This information is provided by the Kepler pixel response function (PRF), defined as the composite of Kepler's optical point-spread function, integrated spacecraft pointing jitter during a nominal cadence and other systematic effects. To provide sub-pixel resolution, the PRF is represented as a piecewise-continuous polynomial on a sub-pixel mesh. This continuous representation allows the prediction of a star's flux value on any pixel given the star's pixel position. The advantages and difficulties of this polynomial representation are discussed, including characterization of spatial variation in the PRF and the smoothing of discontinuities between sub-pixel polynomial patches. On-orbit super-resolution measurements of the PRF across the Kepler field of view are described. Two uses of the PRF are presented: the selection of pixels for each star that maximizes the photometric signal-to-noise ratio for that star, and PRF-fitted centroids which provide robust and accurate stellar positions on the CCD, primarily used for attitude and plate scale tracking. Good knowledge of the PRF has been a critical component for the successful collection of high-precision photometry by Kepler.},

We present the GALAH second public data release (GALAH DR2) containing 342 682 stars. For these stars, the GALAH collaboration provides stellar parameters and abundances for up to 23 elements to the community. Here we present the target selection, observation, data reduction, and detailed explanation of how the spectra were analysed to estimate stellar parameters and element abundances. For the stellar analysis, we have used a multistep approach. We use the physics-driven spectrum synthesis of Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) to derive stellar labels (Teff, log g, [Fe/H], [X/Fe], vmic, vsin i, AKS ) for a representative training set of stars. This information is then propagated to the whole sample with the data-driven method of The Cannon. Special care has been exercised in the spectral synthesis to only consider spectral lines that have reliable atomic input data and are little affected by blending lines. Departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are considered for several key elements, including Li, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe, using 1D MARCS stellar atmosphere models. Validation tests including repeat observations, Gaia benchmark stars, open and globular clusters, and K2 asteroseismic targets lend confidence to our methods and results. Combining the GALAH DR2 catalogue with the kinematic information from Gaia will enable a wide range of Galactic Archaeology studies, with unprecedented detail, dimensionality, and scope.},

Indeed, we benefit from very high quality oscillation spectra, as well as spectroscopic and interferometric observations. Moreover, this system is particularly interesting since both stars are very similar in mass but the A component is orbited by a red dwarf, whereas the B component is orbited by a Jovian planet and thus could have formed a more complex planetary system. In our previous study, we showed that seismic inversions of integrated quantities could be used to constrain microscopic diffusion in the A component. In this study, we analyse the B component in the light of a more regularised inversion.},

The theoretical approach having been tested, we now wish to apply our technique to observations. In that sense, the solar analogues 16CygA and 16CygB, being amongst the best targets in the Kepler field, are probably currently the most well suited stars to test the diagnostic potential of seismic inversions.},

With the expected excellent data from the TESS and PLATO missions, red giants will again play a key role in Galactic studies and stellar physics, thanks to the precise masses and radii determined by asteroseismology. The determination of these quantities is often based on so-called scaling laws, which have been used extensively for main-sequence stars. We show how the SOLA inversion technique can provide robust determinations of the mean density of red giants within 1 per cent of the real value, using only radial oscillations. Combined with radii determinations from Gaia of around 2 per cent precision, this approach provides robust, less model-dependent masses with an error lower than 10 per cent. It will improve age determinations, helping to accurately dissect the Galactic structure and history. We present results on artificial data of standard models, models including an extended atmosphere from averaged 3D simulations and non-adiabatic frequency calculations to test surface effects, and on eclipsing binaries. We show that the inversions provide very robust mean density estimates, using at best seismic information. However, we also show that a distinction between red-giant branch and red-clump stars is required to determine a reliable estimate of the mean density. The stability of the inversion enables an implementation in automated pipelines, making it suitable for large samples of stars.},

Next, we used the identified dipole mixed modes to determine the gravity-mode period spacing by means of an empirical method and by means of the asymptotic relation. In our methodology we consider the phase offset, g, of the asymptotic relation as a free parameter. Results. Using the frequencies of the identified dipole mixed modes for each star in the sample, we derived a value for the gravitymode period spacing using the two different methods. These values differ by less than 5\%. The average precision we achieved for the period spacing derived from the asymptotic relation is better than 1\%, while that of our data-driven approach is 3\%. Conclusions. Good agreement is found between values for the period spacing derived from the asymptotic relation and from the empirical method. The achieved uncertainties are small, but do not support the ultra-high precision claimed in the literature. The precision from our data-driven method is mostly affected by the differing number of observed dipole mixed modes. For the asymptotic relation, the phase offset, g, remains ill defined, but enables a more robust analysis of both the asymptotic period spacing and the dimensionless coupling factor. However, its estimation might still offer a valuable observational diagnostic for future theoretical modeling.},

  abstract = {The chemical composition of stars hosting small exoplanets (with radii less than four Earth radii) appears to be more diverse than that of gas-giant hosts, which tend to be metal-rich. This implies that small, including Earth-size, planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the universe's history when metals were more scarce. We report Kepler spacecraft observations of Kepler-444, a metal-poor Sun-like star from the old population of the Galactic thick disk and the host to a compact system of five transiting planets with sizes between those of Mercury and Venus. We validate this system as a true five-planet system orbiting the target star and provide a detailed characterization of its planetary and orbital parameters based on an analysis of the transit photometry. Kepler-444 is the densest star with detected solar-like oscillations. We use asteroseismology to directly measure a precise age of 11.2 {$\pm$} 1.0 Gyr for the host star, indicating that Kepler-444 formed when the universe was less than 20\% of its current age and making it the oldest known system of terrestrial-size planets. We thus show that Earth-size planets have formed throughout most of the universe's 13.8 billion year history, leaving open the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the Galaxy. The age of Kepler-444 not only suggests that thick-disk stars were among the hosts to the first Galactic planets, but may also help to pinpoint the beginning of the era of planet formation.},

  abstract = {We propose a theoretically and practically improved density-based, hierarchical clustering method, providing a clustering hierarchy from which a simplified tree of significant clusters can be constructed. For obtaining a ``flat'' partition consisting of only the most significant clusters (possibly corresponding to different density thresholds), we propose a novel cluster stability measure, formalize the problem of maximizing the overall stability of selected clusters, and formulate an algorithm that computes an optimal solution to this problem. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current, state-of-the-art, density-based clustering methods on a wide variety of real world data.},

  abstract = {Context. Many of the open clusters listed in modern catalogues were initially reported by visual astronomers as apparent overdensities of bright stars. As observational techniques and analysis methods continue to improve, some of them have been shown to be chance alignments of stars and not true clusters. Recent publications making use of Gaia DR2 data have provided membership lists for over a thousand clusters, however, many nearby objects listed in the literature have so far evaded detection. Aims: We aim to update the Gaia DR2 cluster census by performing membership determinations for known clusters that had been missed by previous studies and for recently-discovered clusters. We investigate a sub-set of non-detected clusters that, according to their literature parameters, should be easily visible in Gaia. Confirming or disproving the existence of old, inner-disc, high-altitude clusters is especially important as their survival or disruption is linked to the dynamical processes that drive the evolution of the Milky Way. Methods: We employed the Gaia DR2 catalogue and a membership assignment procedure, as well as visual inspections of spatial, proper motion, and parallax distributions. We used membership lists provided by other authors when available. Results: We derived membership lists for 150 objects, including ten that were already known prior to Gaia. We compiled a final list of members for 1481 clusters. Among the objects that we are still unable to identify with the Gaia data, we argue that many (mostly putatively old, relatively nearby, high-altitude objects) are not true clusters. Conclusions: At present, the only confirmed cluster located further than 500 pc away from the Galactic plane within the Solar circle is NGC 6791. It is likely that the objects discussed in this study only represent a fraction of the non-physical groupings erroneously listed in the catalogues as genuine open clusters and that those lists need further cleaning.

  abstract = {Context. Open clusters are convenient probes of the structure and history of the Galactic disk. They are also fundamental to stellar evolution studies. The second Gaia data release contains precise astrometry at the submilliarcsecond level and homogeneous photometry at the mmag level, that can be used to characterise a large number of clusters over the entire sky. Aims: In this study we aim to establish a list of members and derive mean parameters, in particular distances, for as many clusters as possible, making use of Gaia data alone. Methods: We compiled a list of thousands of known or putative clusters from the literature. We then applied an unsupervised membership assignment code, UPMASK, to the Gaia DR2 data contained within the fields of those clusters. Results: We obtained a list of members and cluster parameters for 1229 clusters. As expected, the youngest clusters are seen to be tightly distributed near the Galactic plane and to trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way, while older objects are more uniformly distributed, deviate further from the plane, and tend to be located at larger Galactocentric distances. Thanks to the quality of Gaia DR2 astrometry, the fully homogeneous parameters derived in this study are the most precise to date. Furthermore, we report on the serendipitous discovery of 60 new open clusters in the fields analysed during this study.

  abstract = {Abundances of more than one hundred giants in a large sample of metal-rich open clusters in the Galaxy are investigated with Washington photometry. Most of these clusters have no high-dispersion spectroscopic abundance determinations. A revision of the empirical abundance calibrations for Population I giants, based on a much improved data set over previous calibrations, is first presented. The M-T(1) (Fe abundance) calibration changes slightly for stars with Fe/H of about -0.5. The C-M (Fe + CN abundance) calibration is substantially altered for abundances above solar. The net effect brings the two abundance indices into close agreement and eliminates the apparent CN enhancements previously determined for several open clusters. An enhanced sensitivity to Fe abundance is found for both the M - T(1) and especially the C - M index over that determined in previous investigations. Indeed, Delta(C - M) has an Fe abundance sensitivity that exceeds any other photometric abundance index. In view of the relative rarity of CN strength variations in Pop I giants, this index is most useful as a metallicity indicator for these stars. Abundances with an uncertainty of about 0.1 dex are derived for a total of 18 open clusters observed with the Washington system. The abundances are generally in good agreement with prior abundance analyses. No strong evidence is found for CN variations or anomalies in any of the clusters. A comparison with Population I field giants shows that the open cluster giants have normal CN abundances for their FE abundances.},

The inferred rotation rates are 10\textendash 30 days for the {$\approx$}0.2 M He degenerate cores on the RGB and 30\textendash 100 days for the He burning core in a clump star. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Evolution code, we calculate state-of-the-art stellar evolution models of low mass rotating stars from the zero-age main sequence to the cooling white dwarf (WD) stage. We include transport of angular momentum due to rotationally induced instabilities and circulations, as well as magnetic fields in radiative zones (generated by the Tayler\textendash Spruit dynamo). We find that all models fail to predict core rotation as slow as observed on the RGB and during core He burning, implying that an unmodeled angular momentum transport process must be operating on the early RGB of low mass stars. Later evolution of the star from the He burning clump to the cooling WD phase appears to be at nearly constant core angular momentum. We also incorporate the adiabatic pulsation code, ADIPLS, to explicitly highlight this shortfall when applied to a specific Kepler asteroseismic target, KIC8366239.},

  abstract = {Weak magnetic fields have recently been detected in a number of A-type stars, including Vega and Sirius. At the same time, space photometry observations of A- and late B-type stars from Kepler and TESS have highlighted the existence of rotational modulation of surface features akin to stellar spots. Here we explore the possibility that surface magnetic spots might be caused by the presence of small envelope convective layers at or just below the stellar surface, caused by recombination of H and He. Using 1D stellar evolution calculations and assuming an equipartition dynamo, we make simple estimates of field strength at the photosphere. For most models the largest effects are caused by a convective layer driven by second helium ionization. While it is difficult to predict the geometry of the magnetic field, we conclude that the majority of intermediate-mass stars should have dynamo-generated magnetic fields of order a few gauss at the surface. These magnetic fields can appear at the surface as bright spots, and cause photometric variability via rotational modulation, which could also be wide-spread in A-stars. The amplitude of surface magnetic fields and their associated photometric variability is expected to decrease with increasing stellar mass and surface temperature, so that magnetic spots and their observational effects should be much harder to detect in late B-type stars.},

The distribution of these stars spans from late-A or early-F dwarfs to mid-K with periods ranging from less than a day to {$\sim$}8 days. The rotation period distribution has a morphology similar to the coeval Pleiades cluster, suggesting the universal nature of stellar rotation distributions. Employing two different gyrochronology methods, we find an age of 146 Myr for the cluster. Using the same techniques, we infer an age of 134 Myr for the Pleiades measured from existing literature rotation periods. These rotation-derived ages agree with independently determined cluster ages based on the lithium depletion boundary technique. Additionally, we evaluate different gyrochronology models and quantify levels of agreement between the models and the Blanco 1/Pleiades rotation period distributions, including incorporating the rotation distributions of clusters at ages up to 1.1 Gyr. We find the Skumanich-like spin-down rate sufficiently describes the rotation evolution of stars hotter than the Sun; however, we find cooler stars rotating faster than predicted by a Skumanich law, suggesting a mass dependence in the efficiency of stellar angular momentum loss rate. Finally, we compare the Blanco 1 and Pleiades rotation period distributions to available nonlinear angular momentum evolution models. We find they require a significant mass dependence on the initial rotation rate of solar-type stars to reproduce the observed range of rotation periods at a given stellar mass and are furthermore unable to predict the observed over-density of stars along the upper envelope of the clusters' rotation distributions.},

The currently favored model to explain Li enhancement in first-ascent red giants like 2M19411367+4003382 requires deep mixing into the stellar interior. Testing this model requires a measurement of 12C/13C, which is possible to obtain from APOGEE spectra. However, the Li-rich star also has abnormal asteroseismic properties that call into question its membership in the cluster, even though its radial velocity and location on color-magnitude diagrams are consistent with membership. To address these puzzles, we have measured a wide array of abundances in the Li-rich star and three comparison stars using spectra taken as part of the APOGEE survey to determine the degree of stellar mixing, address the question of membership, and measure the surface gravity. We confirm that the Li-rich star is a red giant with the same overall chemistry as the other cluster giants. However, its log g is significantly lower, consistent with the asteroseismology results and suggestive of a very low mass if the star is indeed a cluster member. Regardless of the cluster membership, the 12C/13C and C/N ratios of the Li-rich star are consistent with standard first dredge-up, indicating that Li dilution has already occurred, and inconsistent with internal Li enrichment scenarios that require deep mixing.},

(1993), and the color excess E\_B-V\_, distance modulus (m-M), and age of each cluster are derived. The goal is to provide an homogeneous ranking of the cluster ages. The analysis is made using two types of stellar models in which different prescriptions are adopted for the extension of the convective cores, i.e. either the classical or the overshoot scheme. The stellar models in use are from Alongi et al. (1993), Bressan et al. (1993), and Fagotto et al. (1993a,b). The evolutionary tracks go from the main sequence up to the start of the thermally pulsing regime of the asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. The purpose is to discriminate between the two evolutionary scenarios. It turns out that all the clusters have turn-off masses either slightly greater or equal to the value of 1.1 Msun\_, at which we expect the transition from convective to radiative core H-burning to occur. As far as the mixing mechanism is concerned, the results are not very conclusive. For the youngest clusters of our sample, namely NGC 2682 and NGC 2243, models with convective overshoot seem to provide a slightly better fit of the observed CMD and luminosity function. For the oldest cluster of our sample, namely NGC 6791 with age of 8 Gyr, there is no appreciable difference passing from one scheme to another. Finally, for the remaining clusters, namely Berkeley 39 and NGC 188, the situation is ambiguous. This trend is not surprising, because we expect the convective core and hence associated overshoot to vanish at decreasing turn-off mass and hence increasing age. As expected the ages derived from overshoot models are slightly older than those obtained from standard models. The five clusters on consideration can be ranked as function of the age as follows (the first value refers to classical models, the second one to models with overshoot): NGC 2682 (4.3 Gyr and 4.8 Gyr), NGC 2243 (3.5 Gyr and 3.9 Gyr), Berkeley 39, (6.0 Gyr and 6.5 Gyr), and NGC 188 (7.0 Gyr and 7.5 Gyr). No age difference is found in the case of NGC 6791 for which both types of stellar models yield 8.0 Gyr.},

  abstract = {NGC\textasciitilde 6791 is a rich open cluster that attracted a lot of attention in the last decade. Recent estimates indicate that the mass is even larger, around 5000\textbackslash,\$\textbackslash mathrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. This is quite remarkable: the cluster is in fact 8\textbackslash,Gyr old, while the typical dissolution time for Galactic open clusters is a few Myr only. This might imply that the cluster managed to survive so long either because its original mass was much larger, or because it moved along a preferential orbit. In any case, such combination of old age and large mass is unique among Galactic open clusters, especially for clusters located in the inner regions of the Galactic disk. This is not the only special property of NGC 6791. Its abundance in iron is [Fe/H] \$\textbackslash sim\$ +0.40. again unique among Galactic star clusters of the same age range. Significant dispersions in various elements have been detected, that are not routinely found in Galactic open clusters. The combined UV flux of the few hot HB stars makes the cluster the closest proxy of an elliptical galaxy. This surprising result might indeed indicate that NGC 6791 was massive enough at origin to experience a strong burst of star formation and a fast enrichment.This pletora of unique properties renders NGC 6791 an extremely important object to study and understand.How and where could such a stellar system have formed? Is NGC 6791 just an open cluster? Did it form close to the bulge? How could have survived in the adverse, high-density, environment of the inner Galactic disk?These are difficult questions to answer to, of course. One of the still missing key observational evidence is whether the cluster suffered from tidal interaction, that could have significantly decreased its mass. We find such evidences, and use them as an argument to support a scenario in which the cluster formed as a massive object. We also estimate, using approximate analytic description based on available \$N\$-body models, how much mass NGC\textasciitilde 6791 lost, and which was its probable mass at formation.{$<$}!--EndFragment--{$>$}},

With their super-solar metallicity and ages 3\textendash 8 Gyr, these three clusters represent both very near and ideal stellar aggregates to match the distinctive properties of the evolved stellar populations, as in elliptical galaxies and bulges of spirals. Following a first discussion of NGC 6791 observations in an accompanying paper, here we complete our analysis, also presenting for NGC 6819 and NGC 7142 the first-ever U CCD photometry. The color\textendash magnitude diagram of the three clusters is analyzed in detail, with special emphasis on the hot stellar component. We report, in this regard, one new extreme horizontal-branch star candidate in NGC 6791. For NGC 6819 and 7142, the stellar luminosity function clearly points to a looser radial distribution of faint lower main sequence stars, either as a consequence of cluster dynamical interaction with the Galaxy or as an effect of an increasing fraction of binary stars toward the cluster core, as also observed in NGC 6791. Compared to a reference theoretical model for the Galaxy disk, the analysis of the stellar field along the line of sight of each cluster indicates that a more centrally concentrated thick disk, on a scale length shorter than {$\sim$}2.8 kpc, might better reconcile the lower observed fraction of bright field stars and their white-dwarf progeny.},

This is the first radial-velocity determination from high-resolution spectra for 16 systems. Iron abundances were obtained for 90 and 14 systems from APOGEE and GALAH samples, respectively. To our knowledge 66 of these clusters (57 in APOGEE and 9 in GALAH) do not have previous determinations in the literature.

This intermediate age cluster closely resembles the old open cluster NGC 6791, as far as the chemical composition is concerned. C, N, and O do not show any significant abundance scatter, and they are underabundant with respect to the solar values both in NGC 6253 and NGC 6791. We also find no evident star-to-star scatter in any of the elements measured in both clusters, with the possible exception of Na in NGC 6791. The two clusters show very similar abundances, except for Mg, overabundant in NGC 6791 and not in NGC 6253. Both have solar-scaled \emph{{$\alpha<$}i/{$>$}-elements abundances.

Despite much work and the high internal precision usually achieved, systematic differences of order 100 K (or more) among various scales are still present. We present an investigation based on the infrared flux method aimed at assessing the source of such discrepancies and pin down their origin. We break the impasse among different scales by using a large set of solar twins, stars which are spectroscopically and photometrically identical to the Sun, to set the absolute zero point of the effective temperature scale to within few degrees. Our newly calibrated, accurate and precise temperature scale applies to dwarfs and subgiants, from super-solar metallicities to the most metal-poor stars currently known. At solar metallicities our results validate spectroscopic effective temperature scales, whereas for [Fe/H]{$\lnapprox$} -2.5 our temperatures are roughly 100 K hotter than those determined from model fits to the Balmer lines and 200 K hotter than those obtained from the excitation equilibrium of Fe lines. Empirical bolometric corrections and useful relations linking photometric indices to effective temperatures and angular diameters have been derived. Our results take full advantage of the high accuracy reached in absolute calibration in recent years and are further validated by interferometric angular diameters and space based spectrophotometry over a wide range of effective temperatures and metallicities. {$<$}P /{$>$}Table 8 is only available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via {$<$}A href="http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/512/A54"{$>$}http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/512/A54{$<$}/A{$>$} {$<$}P /{$>$}},

When coupling this information with classical determinations of stellar parameters, such as metallicities, effective temperatures, and angular diameters, powerful new diagnostics for Galactic studies can be obtained. The ongoing Stro\textasciidieresis mgren survey for Asteroseismology and Galactic Archaeology has the goal of transforming the Kepler field into a new benchmark for Galactic studies, similar to the solar neighborhood. Here we present the first results from a stripe centered at a Galactic longitude of 74{$\smwhtcircle$} and covering latitude from about 8{$\smwhtcircle$} to 20{$\smwhtcircle$}, which includes almost 1000 K giants with seismic information and the benchmark open cluster NGC 6819. We describe the coupling of classical and seismic parameters, the accuracy as well as the caveats of the derived effective temperatures, metallicities, distances, surface gravities, masses, and radii. Confidence in the achieved precision is corroborated by the detection of the first and secondary clumps in a population of field stars with a ratio of 2 to 1 and by the negligible scatter in the seismic distances among NGC 6819 member stars. An assessment of the reliability of stellar parameters in the Kepler Input Catalog is also performed, and the impact of our results for population studies in the Milky Way is discussed, along with the importance of an all-sky Stro\textasciidieresis mgren survey.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically luminous giant stars in the Milky Way are the only potential volume-complete tracers of the distant disc, bulge, and halo. The chemical abundances of metal-poor giants also reflect the compositions of the earliest star-forming regions, providing the initial conditions for the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. However, the intrinsic rarity of metal-poor giants combined with the difficulty of efficiently identifying them with broad-band optical photometry has made it difficult to exploit them for studies of the Milky Way. One long-standing problem is that photometric selections for giant and/or metal-poor stars frequently include a large fraction of metal-rich dwarf contaminants. We re-derive a giant star photometric selection using existing public g-band and narrow-band DDO51 photometry obtained in the Kepler field. Our selection is simple and yields a contamination rate of main-sequence stars of 1 per cent and a completeness of about 80 per cent for giant stars with Teff 5250 K \textendash subject to the selection function of the spectroscopic surveys used to estimate these rates, and the magnitude range considered (11 g 15). While the DDO51 filter is known to be sensitive to stellar surface gravity, we further show that the mid-infrared colours of DDO51selected giants are strongly correlated with spectroscopic metallicity. This extends the infrared metal-poor selection developed by Schlaufman \& Casey, demonstrating that the principal contaminants in their selection can be efficiently removed by the photometric separation of dwarfs and giants. This implies that any similarly efficient dwarf/giant discriminant (e.g. Gaia parallaxes) can be used in conjunction with WISE colours to select samples of giant stars with high completeness and low contamination. We employ our photometric selection to identify three metal-poor giant candidates in the Kepler field with global asteroseismic parameters and find that masses inferred for these three stars using standard asteroseismic scaling relations are systematically overestimated by 20\textendash 175 per cent. Taken at face value, this small sample size implies that standard asteroseismic scaling relations overpredict stellar masses for metal-poor giant stars.},

  abstract = {A set of theoretical computations for solar metallicity stellar models is presented, extending previous computations of intermediate-mass stars to lower masses, crossing the RGB phase transition, down to 1-solar-mass stars. Theoretical isochrones and synthetic clusters were produced in the range of ages between 30 and 11,000 Myr, covering the range of age spanned by the large majority of Galactic clusters. The variations among the relative frequencies of subgiants, red giants, and clump stars are not found to be strictly connected to the RGB phase transition. Although the RGB phase transition may be safely settled between 2 and 2.5 solar masses, the mass limit discriminating between clusters dominated by clump stars and those dominated by subgiant stars is of the order of 1.8 solar masses. In the range of ages between 0.6 and 10 Gyr, the luminosity of the central He-burning models is found to be almost insensitive to the age, supporting the use of clump stars to derive the cluster distance moduli.},

  abstract = {Context. The publication of the Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2) opens a  new era in astronomy. It includes precise astrometric data (positions, proper motions, and parallaxes) for more than 1.3 billion sources, mostly stars. To analyse such a vast amount of new data, the use of data-mining techniques and machine-learning algorithms is mandatory. Aims: A great example of the application of such techniques and algorithms is the search for open clusters (OCs), groups of stars that were born and move together, located in the disc. Our aim is to develop a method to automatically explore the data space, requiring minimal manual intervention. Methods: We explore the performance of a density-based clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, to find clusters in the data together with a supervised learning method such as an artificial neural network (ANN) to automatically distinguish between real OCs and statistical clusters. Results: The development and implementation of this method in a five-dimensional space (l, b, {$\varpi$}, {$\mu\alpha$}*, {$\mu\delta$}) with the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) data, and a posterior validation using Gaia DR2 data, lead to the proposal of a set of new nearby OCs.  Conclusions: We have developed a method to find OCs in astrometric data, designed to be applied to the full Gaia DR2 archive.},

  abstract = {One of the most difficult properties to derive for stars is their age. For cool main-sequence stars, gyrochronology relations can be used to infer stellar ages from measured rotation periods and Hertzsprung Russell diagram positions. These relations have few calibrators with known ages for old, long rotation period stars. There is a significant sample of old Kepler objects of interest, or KOIs, which have both measurable surface rotation periods and precise asteroseismic measurements from which ages can be accurately derived. In this work, we determine the age and the rotation period of solar-like pulsating KOIs to both compare the rotation properties of stars with and without known planets and enlarge the gyrochronology calibration sample for old stars. We use Kepler photometric light curves to derive the stellar surface rotation periods while ages are obtained with asteroseismology using the Asteroseismic Modelling Portal in which individual mode frequencies are combined with high-resolution spectroscopic parameters. We thus determine surface rotation periods and ages for 11 planet-hosting stars, all over 2 Gyr old. We find that the planet-hosting stars exhibit a rotational behaviour that is consistent with the latest age-rotation models and similar to the rotational behaviour of stars without detected planets. We conclude that these old KOIs can be used to test and calibrate gyrochronology along with stars not known to host planets.},

The isochrones have been simultaneously fitted to BV and VI color-magnitude diagrams, with the same composition, reddening, and distance modulus required for both colors. Our best-fitting isochrone assumes [Fe/H]=+0.4, scaled solar abundance ratios, and DeltaY/DeltaZ=2 (Y=0.31), yielding an excellent fit to the data at all points along the major sequences. The resulting age is 8 Gyr, with E(B-V)=0.10 and (m-M)\_V=13.42. The derived cluster parameters are fairly robust to variations in the isochrone [Fe/H] and helium abundances. All the acceptable fits indicate that 0.08{$<$}=E(B-V){$<$}=0.13 and 13.30{$<$}=(m-M)\_V{$<$}=13.45 and that NGC 6791 has an age of 8.0+/-0.5 Gyr. The fits also suggest that DeltaY/DeltaZ lies between 1 and 3. A metallicity as low as solar is clearly ruled out, as is DeltaY/DeltaZ=0. Comparison with previous isochrone studies indicates that the derived reddening is primarily due to our use of the most recent color transformations, whereas the age depends on both the colors and the input physics. Our isochrones provide an excellent fit to the Hyades zero-age main sequence as determined by Hipparcos, providing evidence that our derived reddening and distance modulus are reliable.},

Both stars show rich spectra of solar-like oscillations. From the asteroseismic analysis we find that each host has its rotation axis nearly perpendicular to the line of sight with the sines of the angles constrained at the 1{$\sigma$} level to lie above 0.97 and 0.91, respectively.

  abstract = {We use asteroseismic data obtained by the NASA Kepler mission to estimate the fundamental properties of more than 500 main-sequence and sub-giant stars. Data obtained during the first 10 months of Kepler science operations were used for this work, when these solar-type targets were observed for one month each in survey mode. Stellar properties have been estimated using two global asteroseismic parameters and complementary photometric and spectroscopic data. Homogeneous sets of effective temperatures, Teff, were available for the entire ensemble from complementary photometry; spectroscopic estimates of Teff and [Fe/H] were available from a homogeneous analysis of ground-based data on a subset of 87 stars. We adopt a grid-based analysis, coupling six pipeline codes to 11 stellar evolutionary grids. Through use of these different grid-pipeline combinations we allow implicitly for the impact on the results of stellar model dependencies from commonly used grids, and differences in adopted pipeline methodologies. By using just two global parameters as the seismic inputs we are able to perform a homogenous analysis of all solar-type stars in the asteroseismic cohort, including many targets for which it would not be possible to provide robust estimates of individual oscillation frequencies (due to a combination of low signal-to-noise ratio and short dataset lengths). The median final quoted uncertainties from consolidation of the grid-based analyses are for the full ensemble (spectroscopic subset) approximately 10.8\% (5.4\%) in mass, 4.4\% (2.2\%) in radius, 0.017 dex (0.010 dex) in log g, and 4.3\% (2.8\%) in mean density. Around 36\% (57\%) of the stars have final age uncertainties smaller than 1 Gyr. These ages will be useful for ensemble studies, but should be treated carefully on a star-bystar basis. Future analyses using individual oscillation frequencies will offer significant improvements on up to 150 stars, in particular for estimates of the ages, where having the individual frequency data is most important.},

New insights on stellar evolution and stellar interiors physics are being made possible by asteroseismology, the study of stars by the observation of natural, resonant oscillations. Asteroseismology is proving to be particularly significant for the study of solar-type and red-giant stars. These stars show rich spectra of solar-like oscillations, which are excited and intrinsically damped by turbulence in the outermost layers of the convective envelopes. In this review we discuss the current state of the field, with a particular emphasis on recent advances provided by the Kepler and COROT (Convection, Rotation \&amp; Planetary Transits) space missions and the wider significance to astronomy of the results from asteroseismology, such as stellar populations studies and exoplanet studies.},

  abstract = {We consider the prospects for detecting solar-like oscillations in the `super-Nyquist' regime of long-cadence (LC) Kepler photometry, i.e. above the associated Nyquist frequency of 283 {$\mu$}Hz. Targets of interest are cool, evolved subgiants and stars lying at the base of the red giant branch. These stars would ordinarily be studied using the short-cadence (SC) data, since the associated SC Nyquist frequency lies well above the frequencies of the detectable oscillations. However, the number of available SC target slots is quite limited. This imposes a severe restriction on the size of the ensemble available for SC asteroseismic study. We find that archival Kepler LC data from the nominal mission may be utilized for asteroseismic studies of targets whose dominant oscillation frequencies lie as high as 500 {$\mu$}Hz, i.e. about 1.75-times the LC Nyquist frequency. The frequency detection threshold for the shorter duration science campaigns of the re-purposed Kepler mission, K2, is lower. The maximum threshold will probably lie somewhere between 400 and 450 {$\mu$}Hz. The potential to exploit the archival Kepler and K2 LC data in this manner opens the door to increasing significantly the number of subgiant and low-luminosity red giant targets amenable to asteroseismic analysis, overcoming target limitations imposed by the small number of SC slots. We estimate that around 400 such targets are now available for study in the Kepler LC archive. That number could potentially be a lot higher for K2, since there will be a new target list for each of its campaigns.},

Such seismic measurements remained rather scarce for hot B subdwarf (sdB) stars until the advent of space observations with the Kepler spacecraft. Nowadays, however, a number of rotation measurements have become available, offering a glimpse on the global rotational properties of sdB stars. Here, we briefly discuss what asteroseismology starts to reveal on the rotation rate of these stars. We also make connections with the internal rotation of red-giant and white-dwarf stars. In particular, we show that the very slow rotation rates derived for single sdB stars, and their similarities with the dynamical properties of the cores of red-clump stars, strongly suggest that they evolved from red-giants rather than merger events.We also point out that no more angular momentum seems to be lost by stellar cores throughout the helium burning phase until the cooling white-dwarf stage, indicating that all the braking occurs before, most likely during red-giant branch evolution.},

NGC 2126 is an intermediate-age open cluster which has a population of stars inside the {$\delta$} Scuti instability strip. The main purpose is to search for new variable stars, to study their light curves and pulsation spectra. Eleven variables are reported, two of which are new discoveries, eight are pulsating and three eclipsing binary stars, one of which has a pulsating component (V551 Aur). Our 10 times of light minimum along with others compiled from the literature were used to revise the orbital period of V551 Aur: Porb = 1.1731752(8) d. The Wilson\textendash Devinney technique was used to analyse its light curves and to determine a new set of the system's parameters. We found a single pulsation period Ppul = 0.12964977(3) d in the residuals which lies near the 9th harmonic of the orbital period. We determined the accurate value of high proper motion star LHS 1809 as {$\mu\alpha$}cos {$\delta$} = 115.7{$\pm$} 0.1 mas yr-1 and {$\mu\delta$} = -823.7 {$\pm$} 0.1 mas yr-1. From the construction of the colour\textendash magnitude diagram, we estimated the physical parameters of the cluster. We found that the shape of the colour\textendash magnitude diagram at the turn-off point is well reproduced with an isochrone with log(t) of 9.1 {$\pm$} 0.1 yr, metallicity of 0.019, E(B - V) = 0.27{$\pm$} 0.01 mag, and (m - M)0 = 10.80 {$\pm$} 0.05 mag.},

We couple the new MESA Isochrone and Stellar Tracks (MIST) models to the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS) package, extending the stellar population synthesis models to include the contributions from very massive stars ({$>$} 100 \{M\}{$\odot$} ), which can be significant in the first \texttildelow 4 Myr after a starburst. These models predict ionizing luminosities that are consistent with recent observations of young nuclear star clusters. We also construct composite stellar populations assuming a distribution of initial rotation rates. Even in low-metallicity environments where rotation has a significant effect on the evolution of massive stars, we find that stellar population models require a significant contribution from fast-rotating (v/\{v\}\{crit\}{$>$} 0.4) stars in order to sustain the production of ionizing photons beyond a few Myr following a starburst. These results have potentially important implications for cosmic reionization by massive stars and the interpretation of nebular emission lines in high-redshift star-forming galaxies.},

We begin with a pedagogical overview summarizing the effects of stellar model parameters, such as the helium abundance, mass-loss efficiency, and mixing-length parameter, on observational diagnostics such as the color-magnitude diagram, mass-radius relation, and surface abundances, among others. We find that these parameters and the stellar age influence observables in qualitatively distinctive, degeneracy-breaking ways. To assess the current state of affairs, we use the recent Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) along with data from the literature to investigate three well-studied old open clusters\textemdash NGC 6819, M67, NGC 6791\textemdash as case studies. Although there is no obvious tension between the existing observations and the MIST models for NGC 6819, there are interesting discrepancies in the cases of M67 and NGC 6791. At this time, parallax zero-point uncertainties in Gaia DR2 remain one of the limiting factors in the analysis of these clusters. With a combination of exquisite photometry, parallax distances, and cluster memberships from Gaia at the end of its mission, we anticipate precise and accurate ages for these and other star clusters in the Galaxy.},

By modeling the expected transits of all confirmed and candidate planets detected by Kepler as expected to be observed by TESS, we find that TESS has a greater than 50\% chance of detecting 277 of these planets at the 3 sigma level in one sector of observations and an additional 128 planets in two sectors. Most of these are large planets in short orbits around their host stars, although a small number of rocky planets are expected to be recovered. Most of these systems have only one known transiting planet; in only \textasciitilde 5 percent of known multiply-transiting systems do we anticipate more than one planet to be recovered. When these planets are recovered, we expect TESS to be a powerful tool to characterizing transit timing variations. Using Kepler-88 (KOI-142) as an example, we show that TESS will improve measurements of planet-star mass ratios and orbital parameters, and significantly reduce the transit timing uncertainty in future years. Since TESS will be most sensitive to hot Jupiters, we research whether TESS will be able to detect tidal orbital decay in these systems. We find two confirmed planetary systems (Kepler-2 b and Kepler-13 b) and five candidate systems that will be good candidates to detect tidal decay.},

Here, we provide a detailed analysis of this relation, which is found to derive from differences between these two classes of stars in the thermodynamic state of the convective envelope. There is potential for distinguishing red giants and clump stars based on the phase determined from observations that are too short to allow distinction based on determination of the period spacing for mixed modes. The analysis of the phase may also point to a better understanding of the potential for using the helium-ionization-induced acoustic glitch to determine the helium abundance in the envelopes of these stars.},

  abstract = {Observations of a large number of different oscillation frequencies in the Sun provide an opportunity for detailed testing of the theory of stellar structure and evolution. At present highly significant discrepancies remain between observed and computed frequencies, and so our models of the solar interior have to be modified. With further improvements in the observations it might become possible to make a direct empirical determination of the density structure throughout the Sun. Similar oscillations have so far not been detected in other stars, but attempts to do so are under way. Theoretical estimates indicate that amplitudes somewhat greater than for the Sun might be expected for early F stars on the main sequence, and that the amplitude increases rapidly with decreasing gravity. Observation of such oscillations would enable investigations of the structure of these stars, and would in addition provide valuable information about the excitation mechanism of the oscillations.},

  abstract = {Methods. Within the traditional approximation of rotation, we highlight the possibility of recovering the equidistance of period spacings by stretching the pulsation periods. The stretching function depends on the degree and azimuthal order of gravity modes and the rotation rate of the star. In this new stretched space, the pulsation modes are regularly spaced by the stellar buoyancy radius. Results. On the basis of this property, we implemented a method to search for these new regularities and simultaneously infer the rotation frequency and buoyancy radius. Tests on synthetic spectra computed with a non-perturbative approach show that we can retrieve these two parameters with reasonable accuracy along with the mode identification. In uniformly rotating models of a typical {$\gamma$} Dor star, and for the most observed prograde dipole modes, we show that the accuracy on the derived parameters is better than 5\% on both the internal rotation rate and the buoyancy radius. Finally, we apply the method to two stars of the Kepler field, a {$\gamma$} Dor and an SPB, and compare our results with those of other existing methods. Conclusions. We provide a stellar-model-independent method to obtain the near-core rotation rate, the buoyancy radius, and the mode identification from gravity-mode spectra of {$\gamma$} Dor and SPB stars.},

  abstract = {We present a variability analysis of the early-release first quarter of data publicly released by the Kepler project. Using the stellar parameters from the Kepler Input Catalog, we have separated the sample into 129,000 dwarfs and 17,000 giants and further sub-divided the luminosity classes into temperature bins corresponding approximately to the spectral classes A, F, G, K, and M. Utilizing the inherent sampling and time baseline of the public data set (30 minute sampling and 33.5 day baseline), we have explored the variability of the stellar sample. The overall variability rate of the dwarfs is 25\% for the entire sample, but can reach 100\% for the brightest groups of stars in the sample. G dwarfs are found to be the most stable with a dispersion floor of {$\sigma$} {$\sim$} 0.04 mmag. At the precision of Kepler, {$>$}95\% of the giant stars are variable with a noise floor of {$\sim$}0.1 mmag, 0.3 mmag, and 10 mmag for the G giants, K giants, and M giants, respectively. The photometric dispersion of the giants is consistent with acoustic variations of the photosphere; the photometrically derived predicted radial velocity distribution for the K giants is in agreement with the measured radial velocity distribution. We have also briefly explored the variability fraction as a function of data set baseline (1\textendash 33 days), at the native 30 minute sampling of the public Kepler data. To within the limitations of the data, we find that the overall variability fractions increase as the data set baseline is increased from 1 day to 33 days, in particular for the most variable stars. The lower mass M dwarf, K dwarf, and G dwarf stars increase their variability more significantly than the higher mass F dwarf and A dwarf stars as the time baseline is increased, indicating that the variability of the lower mass stars is mostly characterized by timescales of weeks while the variability of the higher mass stars is mostly characterized by timescales of days. A study of the distribution of the variability as a function of galactic latitude suggests that sources closer to the galactic plane are more variable. This may be the result of sampling differing populations (i.e., ages) as a function of latitude or may be the result of higher background contamination that is inflating the variability fractions at lower latitudes. A comparison of the M dwarf statistics to the variability of 29 known bright M dwarfs indicates that the M dwarfs are primarily variable on timescales of weeks or longer presumably dominated by spots and binarity. On shorter timescales of hours, which are relevant for planetary transit detection, the stars are significantly less variable, with {$\sim$}80\% having 12 hr dispersions of 0.5 mmag or less.},

The Specific Object Study (SOS) pipeline, developed to validate and fully characterise Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars (SOS Cep\&RRL) observed by Gaia, has been presented in the documentation and papers accompanying the Gaia first Data Release. Here we describe how the SOS pipeline was modified to allow for processing the Gaia multiband (G, G\_BP and G\_RP) time series photometry of all-sky candidate variables and produce specific results for confirmed RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids that are published in the DR2 catalogue. The SOS Cep\&RRL processing uses tools such as the period-amplitude and the period-luminosity relations in the G band. For the analysis of the Gaia DR2 candidates we also used tools based on the G\_BP and G\_RP photometry, such as the period-Wesenheit relation in (G,G\_RP). Multiband time series photometry and characterisation by the SOS Cep\&RRL pipeline are published in Gaia DR2 for 150,359 such variables (9,575 classified as Cepheids and 140,784 as RR Lyrae stars) distributed all over the sky. The sample includes variables in 87 globular clusters and 14 dwarf galaxies. To the best of our knowledge, as of 25 April 2018, variability of 50,570 of these sources (350 Cepheids and 50,220 RR Lyrae stars) is not known in the literature, hence likely they are new discoveries by Gaia. An estimate of the interstellar absorption is published for 54,272 fundamental-mode RR Lyrae stars from a relation based on the G-band amplitude and the pulsation period. Metallicities derived from the Fourier parameters of the light curves are also released for 64,932 RR Lyrae stars and 3,738 fundamental-mode classical Cepheids with period shorter than 6.3 days.},

In this paper, we present a test of the scaling relation for the global asteroseismic parameter {$\nu$}max, the frequency at which a solar-like oscillator presents its strongest observed pulsation amplitude. The classic relation assumes that this characteristic frequency scales with a particular combination of surface gravity and effective temperature that also describes the dependence of the cut-off frequency for acoustic waves in an isothermal atmosphere, i.e. {$\nu$}max {$\propto$} gTe-ff1/2. We test how well the oscillations of cool main-sequence and subgiant stars adhere to this relation, using a sample of asteroseismic targets observed by the NASA Kepler Mission. Our results, which come from a grid-based analysis, rule out departures from the classic gTe-ff1/2 scaling dependence at the level of 1.5 per cent over the full 1560 K range in Teff that we tested. There is some uncertainty over the absolute calibration of the scaling. However, any variation with Teff is evidently small, with limits similar to those above.},

Alternatively, the observed phenomenon may be due to a close binary orbiting a red giant in a triple system, or chance alignments of foreground or background binary systems contaminating the target pixel aperture. We identify 87 stars in the sample as chance alignments using a combination of pixel Fourier analysis and difference imaging. We find that in the remaining 81 cases, the anomalous peaks are indistinguishable from the target star to within 4 arcsec, suggesting a physical association. We examine a GALAXIA model of the Kepler field of view to estimate background star counts and find that it is highly unlikely that all targets can be explained by chance alignments. From this, we conclude that these stars may comprise a population of physically associated systems.},

We present an analysis of oscillating red giants from which exhibit anomalous peaks in their amplitude spectra. We use close analysis of Kepler pixel data to confirm the source of these anomalous peaks. By analysing the distribution of the population across the Kepler field of view, we find that we are observing two populations, of contamination by a line-of-sight background or foreground binary system, and of physical associations in potential triple systems. Using similar population analysis techniques, we study the distribution of Kepler Objects of Interest to draw conclusions about their designation as either planet hosts or false positives. We use detailed pixel analysis methods to study a rotating subgiant hosting a planet, potential doubly-oscillating red giant-delta Scuti binaries, red giants classified by a neural network. We also extend this work to TESS data, to study a sample of high frequency delta Scuti stars. Finally, we perform image subtraction photometry on the Kepler superstamps, large-scale pixel data covering the open clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 6819. Image subtraction photometry produces high-quality time series data which emphasises stellar variability. We outline the development of an image subtraction photometry pipeline, and present an overview of the results of our search for stellar variability in NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, including detections of stellar rotation, binary systems, and oscillating stars in both clusters.},

The equivalence of the mean shift procedureto the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks, discontinuity preserving smoothing andimage segmentation are described as applications. In these algorithms the only user set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray level or color images are accepted as input.

A new method without that requirement uses stellar oscillations to measure delays in the light arrival time and has been successfully applied to {$\delta$} Scuti stars. However, application to other types of stars has not been explored. To investigate this, we simulated light curves with a range of input parameters. We find a correlation between the signal to noise of the pulsation modes and the time delay required to detect binary motion. The detectability of the binarity in the simulations and in real, Kepler data show strong agreement, hence, we describe the factors that have prevented this method from discovering binary companions to stars belonging to various classes of pulsating stars.},

We aim to characterize this frequency discrepancy for main-sequence solar-like oscillators for a wide range of initial masses and metallicities. We fit stellar models to the observed mode frequencies of the 67 stars, including the Sun, in the Kepler LEGACY sample, using three different empirical surface corrections. The three surface corrections we analyse are a frequency power-law, a cubic frequency term divided by the mode inertia and a linear combination of an inverse and cubic frequency term divided by the mode inertia. We construct a grid of stellar evolution models using the stellar evolution code MESA and calculate mode frequencies using GYRE. We scale the frequencies of each stellar model by an empirical calculated homology coefficient, which greatly improves the robustness of our grid. We calculate stellar parameters and surface corrections for each star using the average of the best-fitting models from each evolutionary track, weighted by the likelihood of each model. The resulting model stellar parameters agree well with an independent reference, the BASTA pipeline. However, we find that the adopted physics of the stellar models has a greater impact on the fitted stellar parameters than the choice of correction method. We find that scaling the frequencies by the mode inertia improves the fit between the models and observations. The inclusion of the inverse frequency term produces substantially better model fits to lower surface gravity stars.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context. {$<$}i/{$>$}It is generally agreed upon that stars form in open clusters (OCs) and stellar associations, but little is known about structures in the Galactic OC population; whether OCs and stellar associations are born isolated or if they prefer to form in groups, for example. Answering this question provides new insight into star and cluster formation, along with a better understanding of Galactic structures.\emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}In the past decade, studies of OC groupings have either been based solely on spatial criteria or have also included tangential velocities for identifications. In contrast to previous approaches, we assumed that real OC groupings occupy a well defined area in the sky and show similar velocity vectors. For the first time, we have used 6D phase-space information, including radial velocities from the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) and other catalogues, for the detection of OC groupings. We also checked the age spread of potential candidates to distinguish between genuine groupings and chance alignments.\emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}We explored the Catalogue of Open Cluster Data (COCD) and determined 6D phase-space information for 432 out of 650 listed OCs and compact associations.

The Monte Carlo simulations revealed that, in particular, the complex is most likely genuine, whereas pairs are more likely chance alignments. A closer look at the age spread of the complex and the comparison between spatial distributions of young and old cluster populations suggested that OC groupings likely originated from a common molecular cloud.}}}}}}},

  abstract = {The detection of mixed oscillation modes offers a unique insight into the internal structure of core helium burning (CHeB) stars. The stellar structure during CHeB is very uncertain because the growth of the convective core, and/or the development of a semiconvection zone, is critically dependent on the treatment of convective boundaries. In this study we calculate a suite of stellar structure models and their non-radial pulsations to investigate why the predicted asymptotic g-mode = 1 period spacing 1 is systematically lower than is inferred from Kepler field stars. We find that only models with large convective cores, such as those calculated with our newly proposed `maximal-overshoot' scheme, can match the average 1 reported. However, we also find another possible solution that is related to the method used to determine 1: mode trapping can raise the observationally inferred 1 well above its true value. Even after accounting for these two proposed resolutions to the discrepancy in average 1, models still predict more CHeB stars with low 1 ( 270 s) than are observed. We establish two possible remedies for this: (i) there may be a difficulty in determining 1 for early CHeB stars (when 1 is lowest) because of the effect that the sharp composition profile at the hydrogen burning shell has on the pulsations, or (ii) the mass of the helium core at the flash is higher than predicted. Our conclusions highlight the need for the reporting of selection effects in asteroseismic population studies in order to safely use this information to constrain stellar evolution theory.},

  abstract = {Theoretical predictions for the core helium burning phase of stellar evolution are highly sensitive to the uncertain treatment of mixing at convective boundaries. In the last few years, interest in constraining the uncertain structure of their deep interiors has been renewed by insights from asteroseismology. Recently, Spruit proposed a limit for the rate of growth of helium-burning convective cores based on the higher buoyancy of material ingested from outside the convective core. In this paper we test the implications of such a limit for stellar models with a range of initial mass and metallicity. We find that the constraint on mixing beyond the Schwarzschild boundary has a significant effect on the evolution late in core helium burning, when core breathing pulses occur and the ingestion rate of helium is fastest. Ordinarily, core breathing pulses prolong the core helium burning lifetime to such an extent that models are at odds with observations of globular cluster populations. Across a wide range of initial stellar masses (0.83 {$\leq$} M/M {$\leq$} 5), applying the Spruit constraint reduces the core helium burning lifetime because core breathing pulses are either avoided or their number and severity reduced. The constraint suggested by Spruit therefore helps to resolve significant discrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions. Specifically, we find improved agreement for R2 (the observed ratio of asymptotic giant branch to horizontal branch stars in globular clusters), the luminosity difference between these two groups, and in asteroseismology, the mixed-mode period spacing detected in red clump stars in the Kepler field.},

Nearly all the clusters younger than \$\textbackslash sim\$2.5 Gyr of both MCs exhibit extended main-sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs) and all the cluster younger than \$\textbackslash sim\$700 Myr show broadened/split main sequences (MSs). High-resolution spectroscopy has revealed that these clusters host stars with a large spread in the observed projected rotations. In addition to rotation, internal age variation is indicated as a possible responsible for the eMSTOs, making these systems the possible young counterparts of globular clusters with multiple populations. Recent work has shown that the eMSTO+broadened MSs are not a peculiarity of MCs clusters. Similar photometric features have been discovered in a few Galactic open clusters, challenging the idea that the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of these systems are similar to single isochrones and opening new windows to explore the eMSTO phenomenon. We exploit photometry+proper motions from Gaia DR2 to investigate the CMDs of open clusters younger than \$\textbackslash sim\$1.5 Gyr. Our analysis suggests that: (i) twelve open clusters show eMSTOs and/or broadened MSs, that cannot be due neither to field contamination, nor binaries; (ii) split/broadened MSs are observed in clusters younger than \$\textbackslash sim\$700 Myr, while older objects display only an eMSTO, similarly to MCs clusters; (iii) the eMSTO, if interpreted as a pure age spread, increases with age, following the relation observed in MCs clusters and demonstrating that rotation is the responsible for this phenomenon.},

We present the asteroseismic diagrams of the asymptotic parameters {$\delta\nu$}02, {$\delta\nu$}01, and epsilon, which show clear correlation with fundamental stellar parameters such as mass and radius. When the stellar populations from the clusters are compared, we see evidence for a difference in mass of the red giant branch stars and possibly a difference in structure of the red clump stars, from our measurements of the small separations {$\delta\nu$}02 and {$\delta\nu$}01. Ensemble \'echelle diagrams and upper limits to the linewidths of l = 0 modes as a function of {$\Delta\nu$} of the clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 6819 are also shown, together with the correlation between the l = 0 ridge width and the T eff of the stars. Lastly, we distinguish between red giant branch and red clump stars through the measurement of the period spacing of mixed dipole modes in 53 stars among all the three clusters to verify the stellar classification from the color-magnitude diagram. These seismic results also allow us to identify a number of special cases, including evolved blue stragglers and binaries, as well as stars in late He-core burning phases, which can be potentially interesting targets for detailed theoretical modeling.},

Stellar clusters therefore play an important role in our understanding of star formation and of the dynamical processes at play. However, investigating the cluster formation is diffcult because the density of the molecular cloud undergoes a change of many orders of magnitude. Hierarchical-step approaches to decompose the problem into different stages are therefore required, as well as reliable assumptions on the initial conditions in the clouds. We report for the first time the use of the full potential of NASA \emph{Kepler{$<$}i/{$>$} asteroseismic observations coupled with 3D numerical simulations, to put strong constraints on the early formation stages of open clusters. Thanks to a Bayesian peak bagging analysis of about 50 red giant members of NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, the two most populated open clusters observed in the nominal \emph{Kepler{$<$}i/{$>$} mission, we derive a complete set of detailed oscillation mode properties for each star, with thousands of oscillation modes characterized. We therefore show how these asteroseismic properties lead us to a discovery about the rotation history of stellar clusters. Finally, our observational findings will be compared with hydrodynamical simulations for stellar cluster formation to constrain the physical processes of turbulence, rotation, and magnetic fields that are in action during the collapse of the progenitor cloud into a proto-cluster.}}},

Metallicity causes a statistically significant change in the amplitude of the granulation activity, with a dependency stronger than that induced by both stellar mass and surface gravity. We also find that the metallicity has a significant impact on the corresponding time scales of the phenomenon. The effect of metallicity on the time scale is stronger than that of mass. Conclusions. A higher metallicity increases the amplitude of granulation and meso-granulation signals and slows down their characteristic time scales toward longer periods. The trend in amplitude is in qualitative agreement with predictions from existing 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar atmospheres from main sequence to red giant stars. We confirm that the granulation activity is not sensitive to changes in the stellar core and that it only depends on the atmospheric parameters of stars.},

Much of the short-timescale variability takes the form of stochastic noise, whose presence may limit the progress of extrasolar planet detection and characterization. In order to lay the groundwork for extracting useful information from these quasi-random signals, we focus on the origin of the granulation-driven component of the variability. We apply existing theoretical scaling relations to predict the star-integrated variability amplitudes for 508 stars with photometric light curves measured by the Kepler mission. We also derive an empirical correction factor that aims to account for the suppression of convection in F-dwarf stars with magnetic activity and shallow convection zones. So that we can make predictions of specific observational quantities, we performed Monte Carlo simulations of granulation light curves using a Lorentzian power spectrum. These simulations allowed us to reproduce the so-called flicker floor (i.e., a lower bound in the relationship between the full light-curve range and power in short-timescale fluctuations) that was found in the Kepler data. The Monte Carlo model also enabled us to convert the modeled fluctuation variance into a flicker amplitude directly comparable with observations. When the magnetic suppression factor described above is applied, the model reproduces the observed correlation between stellar surface gravity and flicker amplitude. Observationally validated models like these provide new and complementary evidence for a possible impact of magnetic activity on the properties of near-surface convection.},

  abstract = {The Kepler space telescope yielded unprecedented data for the study of solar-like oscillations in other stars. The large samples of multi-year observations posed an enormous data analysis challenge that has only recently been surmounted. Asteroseismic modeling has become more sophisticated over time, with better methods gradually developing alongside the extended observations and improved data analysis techniques. We apply the latest version of the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal (AMP) to the full-length Kepler data sets for 57 stars, comprising planetary hosts, binaries, solar-analogs, active stars, and for validation purposes, the Sun. From an analysis of the derived stellar properties for the full sample, we identify a variation of the mixing-length parameter with atmospheric properties. We also derive a linear relation between the stellar age and a characteristic frequency separation ratio. In addition, we find that the empirical correction for surface effects suggested by Kjeldsen and coworkers is adequate for solar-type stars that are not much hotter (Teff {$<\sim$} 6200 K) or significantly more evolved (log g {$>\sim$} 4.2, {$\increment\nu$} {$>\sim$} 80 \textmu Hz) than the Sun. Precise parallaxes from the Gaia mission and future observations from TESS and PLATO promise to improve the reliability of stellar properties derived from asteroseismology.},

For four of these stars, we derive atmospheric parameters from spectra acquired with the Nordic Optical Telescope. The global seismic quantities (average large frequency separation and frequency of maximum power), combined with the atmospheric parameters, yield the mean density and surface gravity with precisions of 2\% and {$\sim$}0.03 dex, respectively. We also determine the radius, mass, and age with precisions of 2\textendash 5\%, 7\textendash 11\%, and {$\sim$}35\%, respectively, using grid-based analyses. Coupling the stellar parameters with photometric data yields an asteroseismic distance with a precision better than 10\%. A v sin i measurement provides a rotational period-inclination correlation, and using the rotational periods from the recent literature, we constrain the stellar inclination for three of the stars. An Li abundance analysis yields an independent estimate of the age, but this is inconsistent with the asteroseismically determined age for one of the stars. We assess the performance of five grid-based analysis methods and find them all to provide consistent values of the surface gravity to {$\sim$}0.03 dex when both atmospheric and seismic constraints are at hand. The different grid-based analyses all yield fitted values of radius and mass to within 2.4{$\sigma$}, and taking the mean of these results reduces it to 1.5{$\sigma$}. The absence of a metallicity constraint when the average large frequency separation is measured with a precision of 1\% biases the fitted radius and mass for the stars with non-solar metallicity (metal-rich KIC 11395018 and metal-poor KIC 10273246), while including a metallicity constraint reduces the uncertainties in both of these parameters by almost a factor of two. We found that including the average small frequency separation improves the determination of the age only for KIC 11395018 and KIC 11234888, and for the latter this improvement was due to the lack of strong atmospheric constraints.},

We detected two spots ({$\increment$}m\textasciitilde 0.01) at different latitudes (20.0d, 31.5d) revolving with different periods (11.35 days, 11.55 days), from which we derive a differential rotation coefficient, k=0.11\textsuperscript{+.03}\textsubscript{-.02}, in agreement with the prediction by Brown and coworkers for a young Sun-like star having roughly twice the solar angular velocity. The light curve was analyzed with the program StarSpotz, a modification of SPOTMODEL by Rib\'arik and coworkers. The best-fitting value for the inclination angle i=30\textsuperscript{deg}+/-3\textsuperscript{deg} is compatible with inclinations already estimated for the disk (\textasciitilde 25\textdegree ) and planetary orbit (26.2d). The inclination also leads to an equatorial rotation speed of 3.42 km s\textsuperscript{-1} and the photometric value of vsini=1.7 km s\textsuperscript{-1}. When compared with spectroscopically determined values, the photometric vsini allows, in principle, an independent estimate of the macroturbulent velocity. Both spots would have distorted the radial velocity curve \textasciitilde +/-10 m s\textsuperscript{-1} by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, which is similar to the stellar radial velocity ``noise'' detected by others. Details of the StarSpotz model and of the uniqueness tests that we applied in order to arrive at a best solution and realistic estimates of errors in the derived parameters are given.

  abstract = {Main sequence turnoff ages in young open clusters are complicated by turnoffs that are sparse, have high binarity fractions, can be affected by differential reddening, and typically include a number of peculiar stars. Furthermore, stellar rotation can have a significant effect on a star's photometry and evolutionary timescale. In this paper we analyze in 12 nearby open clusters, ranging from ages of 50 Myr to 350 Myr, how broadband UBV color-color relations can be used to identify turnoff stars that are Be stars, blue stragglers, certain types of binaries, or those affected by differential reddening. This UBV color-color analysis also directly measures a cluster's E(B-V) and estimates its [Fe/H]. The turnoff stars unaffected by these peculiarities create a narrower and more clearly defined cluster turnoff. Using four common isochronal models, two of which consider rotation, we fit cluster parameters using these selected turnoff stars and the main sequence. Comparisons of the photometrically fit cluster distances to those based on Gaia DR2 parallaxes find that they are consistent for all clusters. For older ({$>$}100 Myr) clusters, like the Pleiades and the Hyades, comparisons to ages based on the lithium depletion boundary method finds that these cleaned turnoff ages agree to within \textasciitilde 10\% for all four isochronal models. For younger clusters, however, only the Geneva models that consider rotation fit turnoff ages consistent with lithium-based ages, while the ages based on non-rotating isochrones quickly diverge to become 30\% to 80\% younger. This illustrates the importance of rotation for deriving ages in the youngest ({$<$}100 Myr) clusters.},

  abstract = {Extended horizontal branch (EHB) stars are common but poorly understood stars observed in the field (subdwarf B/O; sdB/sdO), in globular clusters, and in the metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791. These stars are very hot with extremely thin hydrogen-rich envelopes, which requires that they have undergone significant mass loss beyond that explained by models. A common theory is that their envelopes have been stripped by binary companions. While a majority of the field sdB stars are found to be short-period binaries, spectroscopically observed EHB stars in globular cluster are predominantly single stars. Does this suggest that their mechanisms of formation are distinct in these differing environments? We propose to test this by spectroscopically targeting the EHB stars in the open cluster NGC 6791. The nature of the EHB population in this cluster provides two potentially exciting results. If we find that the EHB stars are binaries, it suggests that in the significantly more dense environment of globulars their binarity has been disrupted. Otherwise, if we find they are singly evolved, this suggests that either the multiple populations observed in both environments or the very high metallicity, if not both, plays an important role. Multiple epochs of brief spectroscopic observations of these EHB stars in NGC 6791 will verify their cluster membership, detect if they are short period binaries, determine their v sin i, and be used to fit models for determining their stellar parameters.},

We have also acquired additional signal on eight white dwarfs previously analyzed in the NGC 2099 cluster field, four of which are consistent with membership. These re-observed white dwarfs have masses ranging from 0.72 to 0.97 M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}, with initial masses from 3.0 to 3.65 M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}, where the IFMR has an important change in slope that these new data help to observationally confirm. In total, this directly measured IFMR has small scatter ({$\sigma$} = 0.06 M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}) and spans from progenitors of 0.85 to 7.5 M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}. Applying two different stellar evolutionary models to infer two different sets of white dwarf progenitor masses shows that, when the same model is also used to derive the cluster ages, the resulting IFMR has weak sensitivity to the adopted model at all but the highest initial masses (\&gt;5.5 M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}). The nonlinearity of the IFMR is also clearly observed with moderate slopes at lower masses (0.08 M \textsubscript{final}/M \textsubscript{initial}) and higher masses (0.11 M \textsubscript{final}/M \textsubscript{initial}) that are broken up by a steep slope (0.19 M \textsubscript{final}/M \textsubscript{initial}) between progenitors from 2.85 to 3.6 M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}. This IFMR shows total stellar mass loss ranges from 33\% of M \textsubscript{initial} at 0.83 M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}} to 83\% of M \textsubscript{initial} at 7.5 M \textsubscript{{$\Sun$}}. Testing this total mass loss for dependence on progenitor metallicity, however, finds no detectable sensitivity across the moderate range of -0.15 \&lt; [Fe/H] \&lt; +0.15.

  abstract = {Stellar rotation was proposed as a potential age diagnostic that is precise, simple, and applicable to a broad range of low-mass stars (1 ). Unfortunately, rotation period () measurements of low-mass members of open clusters have undermined the idea that stars spin down with a common age dependence (i.e., ): K dwarfs appear to spin down more slowly than F and G dwarfs. Ag\"ueros et al. interpreted data for the {$\approx$}1.4 Gyr-old cluster NGC 752 differently, proposing that after having converged onto a slow-rotating sequence in their first 600\textendash 700 Myr (by the age of Praesepe), K dwarf stall on that sequence for an extended period of time. We use data from Gaia DR2 to identify likely single-star members of the {$\approx$}1 Gyr-old cluster NGC 6811 with Kepler light curves. We measure for 171 members, more than doubling the sample relative to the existing catalog and extending the mass limit from to {$\approx$}0.6 . We then apply a gyrochronology formula calibrated with Praesepe and the Sun to 27 single G dwarfs in NGC 6811 to derive a precise gyrochronological age for the cluster of 1.04 {$\pm$} 0.07 Gyr. However, when our new low-mass rotators are included, NGC 6811's color\textendash{} sequence deviates away from the naive 1 Gyr projection down to K (K5V, 0.7 ), where it clearly overlaps with Praesepe's. Combining these data with for other clusters, we conclude that the assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is invalid. Furthermore, the cluster data show definitively that stars experience a temporary epoch of reduced braking efficiency where stall, and that the duration of this epoch lasts longer for lower-mass stars.},

  abstract = {We present the first evidence of clear signatures of tidal distortions in the density distribution of the fascinating open cluster NGC 6791. We used deep and wide-field data obtained with the Canada\textendash France\textendash Hawaii Telescope covering a 2{$\smwhtcircle$} \texttimes{} 2{$\smwhtcircle$} area around the cluster. The 2D density map obtained with the optimal matched filter technique shows a clear elongation and an irregular distribution starting from {$\sim$}300 arcsec from the cluster centre. At larger distances, two tails extending in opposite directions beyond the tidal radius are also visible. These features are aligned to both the absolute proper motion and to the Galactic Centre directions. Moreover, other overdensities appear to be stretched in a direction perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Accordingly to the behaviour observed in the density map, we find that both the surface brightness and the star count density profiles reveal a departure from a King model starting from {$\sim$}600 arcsec from the centre. These observational evidence suggest that NGC 6791 is currently experiencing mass-loss likely due to gravitational shocking and interactions with the tidal field. We use this evidence to argue that NGC 6791 should have lost a significant fraction of its original mass. A larger initial mass would in fact explain why the cluster survived so long. Using available recipes based on analytic studies and N-body simulations, we derived the expected mass-loss due to stellar evolution and tidal interactions and estimated the initial cluster mass to be Mini = (1.5\textendash 4) \texttimes{} 105 M .},

  abstract = {The Kepler satellite has provided photometric timeseries data of unprecedented length, duty cycle and precision. To fully analyse these data for the tens of thousands of stars observed by Kepler, automated methods are a prerequisite. Here, we present an automated procedure to determine the period spacing of gravity modes in red giant stars ascending the red giant branch. The gravity modes reside in a cavity in the deep interior of the stars and provide information on the conditions in the stellar core. However, for red giants the gravity modes are not directly observable on the surface, hence this method is based on the pressure-gravity mixed modes that present observable features in the Fourier power spectrum. The method presented here is based on the vertical alignment and symmetry of these mixed modes in a period echelle diagram. We find that we can obtain reliable results for both model frequencies and observed frequencies. Additionally, we carried out Monte Carlo tests to obtain realistic uncertainties on the period spacings with different set of oscillation modes (for the models) and uncertainties on the frequencies. Furthermore, this method has been used to improve mode detection and identification of the observed frequencies in an iterative manner.},

An iterative light curve de-trending approach was used to filter out both astrophysical and systematic variability to detect flares. The flare recovery completeness has also been computed throughout each light curve using artificial flare injection tests, and the tools for this work have been made publicly available. The final sample contains 851,168 candidate flare events recovered above the 68\% completeness threshold, which were detected from 4041 stars, or 1.9\% of the stars in the Kepler database. The average flare energy detected is {$\sim$}1035 erg. The net fraction of flare stars increases with g-i color, or decreasing stellar mass. For stars in this sample with previously measured rotation periods, the total relative flare luminosity is compared to the Rossby number. A tentative detection of flare activity saturation for low-mass stars with rapid rotation below a Rossby number of {$\sim$}0.03 is found. A power-law decay in flare activity with Rossby number is found with a slope of -1, shallower than typical measurements for X-ray activity decay with Rossby number.},

Using available Kepler short cadence data up to Quarter 16 we create power spectra optimized for asteroseismology of solar-type stars. We identify modes of oscillation and estimate mode frequencies by `peak bagging' using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework. In addition, we expand the methodology of quality assurance using a Bayesian unsupervised machine learning approach. We report the measured frequencies of the modes of oscillation for all 35 stars and frequency ratios commonly used in detailed asteroseismic modelling. Due to the high correlations associated with frequency ratios we report the covariance matrix of all frequencies measured and frequency ratios calculated. These frequencies, frequency ratios, and covariance matrices can be used to obtain tight constraint on the fundamental parameters of these planet-hosting stars.},

We present a correction for these Doppler shifts and use previously published pulsation frequencies to demonstrate the significance of the effect.

Proper motions are used for accurate membership selection, especially crucial in the cluster outskirts. Due to the severe crowding in the centres, the Gaia data is supplemented by literature data from HST and surface brightness measurements, where available. This results in 81 clusters with a complete density profile covering the full tidal radius (and beyond) for each cluster. We model the density profiles using a set of single-mass models ranging from King and Wilson models to generalised lowered isothermal limepy models and the recently introduced spes models, which allow for the inclusion of potential escapers. We find that both King and Wilson models are too simple to fully reproduce the density profiles, with King (Wilson) models on average underestimating(overestimating) the radial extent of the clusters. The truncation radii derived from the limepy models are similar to estimates for the Jacobi radii based on the cluster masses and their orbits. We show clear correlations between structural and environmental parameters, as a function of Galactocentric radius and integrated luminosity. Notably, the recovered fraction of potential escapers correlates with cluster pericentre radius, luminosity and cluster concentration. The ratio of half mass over Jacobi radius also correlates with both truncation parameter and PE fraction, showing the effect of Roche lobe filling.},

However, populations of wide binaries evolve over time due to interactions within a system's birth environment and the unfolding of wide, hierarchical triple systems. Hence, the wide binary populations observed in star-forming regions or OB associations may not accurately reflect the wide binary populations that will eventually reach the field. We use Gaia DR2 data to select members of three open clusters, Alpha Per, the Pleiades, and Praesepe and to flag cluster members that are likely unresolved binaries due to overluminosity or elevated astrometric noise. We then identify the resolved wide binary population in each cluster, separating it from coincident pairings of unrelated cluster members. We find that these clusters have an average wide binary fraction in the 300-3000 au projected separation range of 2.1 \$\textbackslash pm \^\{0.4\}\_\{0.2\}\$ per cent increasing to 3.0 \$\textbackslash pm \^\{0.8\}\_\{0.7\}\$ per cent for primaries with masses in the 0.5-1.5 M{$\odot$} range. This is significantly below the observed field wide binary fraction, but shows some wide binaries survive in these dynamically highly processed environments. We compare our results with another open cluster (the Hyades) and two populations of young stars that likely originated in looser associations (young moving groups and the Pisces-Eridanus stream). We find that the Hyades also has a deficit of wide binaries while the products of looser associations have wide binary fractions at or above field level.},

We used the Toulouse Geneva Evolution Code (TGEC), which includes complete atomic diffusion (including radiative accelerations). We compared the predicted surface abundances with the spectroscopic observations and confirm that another mixing process is needed. We then included the effect of accretion-induced fingering convection. Results. The accretion of planetary matter does not change the metal abundances but leads to lithium destruction, which depends upon the accreted mass. A fraction of the Earth's mass is enough to explain the lithium surface abundances of 16 Cygni B. We also checked the beryllium abundances. Conclusions. In the case of accretion of heavy matter onto stellar surfaces, the accreted heavy elements do not remain in the outer convective zones, but are mixed downwards by fingering convection induced by the unstable {$\mu$}-gradient. Depending on the accreted mass, this mixing process may transport lithium down to its nuclear destruction layers and lead to an extra lithium depletion at the surface. A fraction of the Earth's mass is enough to explain a lithium ratio of 4.7 in the 16 Cygni system. In this case beryllium is not destroyed. Such a process may be frequent in planet-hosting stars and should be studied in other cases in the future.},

We built and compared several grids of stellar models including gravitational settling, some with and others without radiative accelerations. We considered masses in the range [0.9, 1.5] M and three values of the metallicity around the solar value. For each metallicity we determined the mass range where differences between models due to radiative accelerations exceed the uncertainties of global seismic parameters of the Kepler Legacy sample or expected for PLATO observations. Results. We found that radiative accelerations may not be neglected for stellar masses higher than 1.1 M at solar metallicity. The difference in age due to their inclusion in models can reach 9\% for the more massive stars of our grids. We estimated that the percentage of the PLATO core program stars whose modelling would require radiative accelerations ranges between 33\% and 58\% depending on the precision of the seismic data. Conclusions. We conclude that in the context of Kepler, TESS, and PLATO missions which provide (or will provide) high-quality seismic data, radiative accelerations can have a significant effect when properly inferring the properties of solar-like oscillators. This is particularly important for age inferences. However, the net effect for each individual star results from the competition between atomic diffusion including radiative accelerations and other internal transport processes. Rotationally induced transport processes for instance are believed to reduce the effects of atomic diffusion. This will be investigated in a forthcoming companion paper.},

We first tested and validated a seismic diagnostic that was proposed to probe the extent of convective cores in a modeldependent way using the so-called r010 ratios, which are built with l = 0 and l = 1 modes. We applied this procedure to 24 low-mass stars chosen among Kepler targets to optimize the efficiency of this diagnostic. For this purpose, we computed grids of stellar models with both the Cesam2k and mesa evolution codes, where the extensions of convective cores were modeled either by an instantaneous mixing or as a diffusion process. Results. We found that 10 stars in our sample are in fact subgiants. Among the other targets, were able to unambiguously detect convective cores in eight stars, and we obtained seismic measurements of the extent of the mixed core in these targets with a good agreement between the Cesam2k and mesa codes. By performing optimizations using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, we then obtained estimates of the amount of extra mixing beyond the core that is required in Cesam2k to reproduce seismic observations for these eight stars, and we showed that this can be used to propose a calibration of this quantity. This calibration depends on the prescription chosen for the extra mixing, but we found that it should also be valid for the code mesa, provided the same prescription is used. Conclusions. This study constitutes a first step toward calibrating the extension of convective cores in low-mass stars, which will help reduce the uncertainties on the ages of these stars.},

  abstract = {Methods. We show that in the cases where asymmetrical multiplets were detected, near-degeneracy effects are expected to occur, because of the combined effects of rotation and mode mixing. Such effects have not been taken into account so far. By using both perturbative and non-perturbative approaches, we show that near-degeneracy effects produce multiplet asymmetries that are very similar to the observations. We then propose and validate a method based on the perturbative approach to probe the internal rotation of red giants using multiplet asymmetries. Results. We successfully apply our method to the asymmetrical l = 2 multiplets of the Kepler young red giant KIC 7341231 and obtain precise estimates of its mean rotation in the core and the envelope. The observed asymmetries are reproduced with a good statistical agreement, which confirms that near-degeneracy effects are very likely the cause of the detected multiplet asymmetries. Conclusions. We expect near-degeneracy effects to be important for l = 2 mixed modes all along the red giant branch (RGB). For l = 1 modes, these effects can be neglected only at the base of the RGB. They must therefore be taken into account when interpreting rotational splittings and as shown here, they can bring valuable information about the internal rotation of red giants.},

  abstract = {Rotation is expected to have an important influence on the structure and the evolution of stars. However, the mechanisms of angular momentum transport in stars remain theoretically uncertain and very complex to take into account in stellar models. To achieve a better understanding of these processes, we desperately need observational constraints on the internal rotation of stars, which until very recently was restricted to the Sun. In this paper, we report the detection of mixed modes\textemdash i.e., modes that behave both as g modes in the core and as p modes in the envelope\textemdash in the spectrum of the early red giant KIC 7341231, which was observed during one year with the Kepler spacecraft. By performing an analysis of the oscillation spectrum of the star, we show that its non-radial modes are clearly split by stellar rotation and we are able to determine precisely the rotational splittings of 18 modes. We then find a stellar model that reproduces very well the observed atmospheric and seismic properties of the star. We use this model to perform inversions of the internal rotation profile of the star, which enables us to show that the core of the star is rotating at least five times faster than the envelope. This will shed new light on the processes of transport of angular momentum in stars. In particular, this result can be used to place constraints on the angular momentum coupling between the core and the envelope of early red giants, which could help us discriminate between the theories that have been proposed over the last few decades.},

We then performed a seismic modeling of these stars using the evolutionary codes Cesam2k and astec. By using the observed splittings and the rotational kernels of the optimal models, we inverted the internal rotation profiles of the six stars. Results. We obtain estimates of the core rotation rates for these stars, and upper limits to the rotation in their convective envelope. We show that the rotation contrast between the core and the envelope increases during the subgiant branch. Our results also suggest that the core of subgiants spins up with time, while their envelope spins down. For two of the stars, we show that a discontinuous rotation profile with a deep discontinuity reproduces the observed splittings significantly better than a smooth rotation profile. Interestingly, the depths that are found to be most probable for the discontinuities roughly coincide with the location of the H-burning shell, which separates the layers that contract from those that expand. Conclusions. We characterized the differential rotation pattern of six young giants with a range of metallicities, and with both radiative and convective cores on the main sequence. This will bring observational constraints to the scenarios of angular momentum transport in stars. Moreover, if the existence of sharp gradients in the rotation profiles of young red giants is confirmed, it is expected to help in distinguishing between the physical processes that could transport angular momentum in the subgiant and red giant branches.},

We then use these splittings to estimate the amount of differential rotation by using inversion techniques and by applying a simplified approach based on asymptotic theory. Results. We obtain evidence for a weak radial differential rotation for six of the seven targets that were selected, with the central regions rotating from 1.8 {$\pm$} 0.3 to 3.2 {$\pm$} 1.0 times faster than the envelope. The last target is found to be consistent with a solid-body rotation. Conclusions. This demonstrates that an efficient redistribution of angular momentum occurs after the end of the main sequence in the interior of intermediate-mass stars, either during the short-lived subgiant phase or once He-burning has started in the core. In either case, this should bring constraints on the angular momentum transport mechanisms that are at work.},

The effective time-scale of the granulation agrees with the extrapolated scalings of red giant stars. Non-detection of solar-like oscillations indicates that the pulsation inhibits other oscillations.

In order to overcome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars, we present a procedure to extract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. We find not only that the core rotates from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the surface, confirming previous inversion results generated for other red giants (Deheuvels et al.), but we also estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core with a spatial resolution of 0.001R and verify the hypothesis of a sharp discontinuity in the inner stellar rotation. The results show that the entire core rotates rigidly and provide evidence for an angular velocity gradient around the base of the hydrogen-burning shell; however, we do not succeed in characterizing the rotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. The angular velocity, from the edge of the core, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reaching an average value in the convective envelope of 68{$\pm$}22nHz. We conclude that a set of data that includes only dipolar modes is sufficient to infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the dense core but also, with a lower level of confidence, in part of the radiative region and in the convective envelope.},

We adopted the Bayesian inference code DIAMONDS for the peak bagging analysis and asteroseismic splitting inversion methods to derive the internal rotational profile of the star. The detection of new splittings of mixed modes, which are more concentrated in the very inner part of the helium core, allowed us to reconstruct the angular velocity profile deeper into the interior of the star and to disentangle the details better than in Paper I: the helium core rotates almost rigidly about 6 times faster than the convective envelope, while part of the hydrogen shell seems to rotate at a constant velocity about 1.15 times lower than the He core. In particular, we studied the internal shear layer between the fast-rotating radiative interior and the slow convective zone and we found that it lies partially inside the hydrogen shell above r;0.05R and extends across the core\textendash envelope boundary. Finally, we theoretically explored the possibility for the future capabilty to sound the convective envelope in the red-giant stars and we concluded that the inversion of a set of splittings with only low-harmonic degree l3, even supposing a very large number of modes, will not allow us to resolve the rotational profile of this region in detail.},

For 724 clusters, this is the first determination of proper motion, and for the whole sample, we present results with a much larger number of identified astrometric member stars. Furthermore, it was possible to estimate the mean radial velocity of 364 clusters (102 unpublished so far) with the stellar membership using published radial velocity catalogs.

This Letter aims to assess their evolutionary status, derive their rotation and ages, and identify those which are solar analogs or solar twin candidates. We separate out the subgiants that compose a large fraction of the asteroseismic sample, and which show an increase in the average rotation period as the stars ascend the subgiant branch. The rotation periods of the dwarfs, ranging from 6 to 30 days and averaging 19 days, allow us to assess their individual evolutionary states on the main sequence and to derive their ages using gyrochronology. These ages are found to be in agreement with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.79 with independent asteroseismic ages, where available. As a result of this investigation, we are able to identify 34 stars as solar analogs and 22 of them as solar twin candidates.},

  abstract = {Determining fundamental properties of stars through stellar modeling has improved substantially due to recent advances in asteroseismology. Thanks to the unprecedented data quality obtained by space missions, particularly CoRoT and Kepler, invaluable information is extracted from the high-precision stellar oscillation frequencies, which provide very strong constraints on possible stellar models for a given set of classical observations. In this work, we have characterized two relatively faint stars, KIC 10920273 and KIC 11395018, using oscillation data from Kepler photometry and atmospheric constraints from ground-based spectroscopy. Both stars have very similar atmospheric properties; however, using the individual frequencies extracted from the Kepler data, we have determined quite distinct global properties, with increased precision compared to that of earlier results. We found that both stars have left the main sequence and characterized them as follows: KIC 10920273 is a one-solar-mass star (M = 1.00 {$\pm$} 0.04 M ), but much older than our Sun (t = 7.12 {$\pm$} 0.47 Gyr), while KIC 11395018 is significantly more massive than the Sun (M = 1.27 {$\pm$} 0.04 M ) with an age close to that of the Sun (t = 4.57 {$\pm$} 0.23 Gyr). We confirm that the high lithium abundance reported for these stars should not be considered to represent young ages, as we precisely determined them to be evolved subgiants. We discuss the use of surface lithium abundance, rotation, and activity relations as potential age diagnostics.},

I discuss situations in which stellar physics leads to departures from the otherwise monotonic relation between initial stellar mass and lifetime, and how these may be dealt with in isochrone construction. I close with convergence tests and recommendations for the number of points in the uniform basis and the mass between tracks in the original grid required to achieve a certain level accuracy in the resulting isochrones.

(\textbackslash cite\{monin\}) yields a sample of 14 binaries and one triple system, with resolved spectroscopy and/or near-infrared photometry.

(\textbackslash cite\{hss\}) and Prato \& Simon (\textbackslash cite\{prato\_simon\}), we show that the trend of binary TTS to be twins holds to separations up to 13''. This is unlikely to be the result of random pairing, and confirms previous results that both stars in young binaries accrete over the same time span. In binary systems where both stars are still accreting, our measurements show that the most massive star is usually the component with the largest accretion rate by up to a factor of 10, as determined from the H{$\alpha$} luminosity.

The frequency and main characteristics of multiple systems, and their dependence on primary mass and environment, are powerful tools to probe this process. Although early attempts were fraught with selection biases and limited completeness, instrumentation breakthroughs in the past two decades now enable robust statistical analyses. In this review, we summarize current empirical knowledge of stellar multiplicity for main sequence stars and brown dwarfs, as well as among populations of pre-main-sequence stars and embedded protostars. Among field objects, the multiplicity rate and breadth of the orbital period distribution are steep functions of the primary mass, whereas the mass ratio distribution is essentially flat for most populations other than the lowest mass objects. The time-variation of the frequency of visual companions follows two parallel, constant tracks corresponding to loose and dense stellar populations, although current observations do not yet distinguish whether initial multiplicity properties are universal or dependent on the physical conditions of the parent cloud. Nonetheless, these quantitative trends provide a rich comparison basis for numerical and analytical models of star formation.},

(2) The short binaries are circularized up to orbital periods of about 11 d due to the tidal evolution effects - a result compatible with the mean age of the Galactic disk. (3) The tight binaries not affected by tidal effects (in the range between 11 and 1000 d) may reflect the initial binary formation process, and they have a mean eccentricity of 0.31 +/-0.04.

  abstract = {A selected sample of 1400 AO/1 to F2/(log Te=3.96 to 3.82) stars with accurate photometric and astrometric data are discussed on the basis of luminosities obtained from both Str\"omgren+H/? and Geneva photometry. The sample contains members of the Hyades, Sirius, and HR 1614 superclusters, all of which show an appreciable age spread. The spread of 6 to 20X108 yr in the Hyades supercluster is reflected in a spread of about 6 to 10X108 yr in the Praesepe and Hyades clusters within the supercluster. Strong arguments are presented for the presence of a larger age spread in the noncluster supercluster members than in the contained clusters. The age range for members of the Sirius supercluster is 2 to 6X108 yr and nearly all of this range is seen in the UMa nucleus of the Sirius supercluster, contained within the supercluster. The HR 1614 supercluster is near 4X109 yr old and may include the old disk cluster NGC 6791. About three-quarters of bright A-star sample consists of young disk stars, on the basis of their (U, V) velocities. The Am, USPC (Set), and X Boo stars represent about 10\%, 6\%, and 1\%, respectively, of the total sample as well as of the young disk and old disk constituents of the sample. Although at least 7 USPC ({$<$}5Sct) are also Am stars, the two types, generally, are separated by about 2X108 yr. The rotational velocities, at various temperatures intervals, of the Am stars are about one-half those of the USPC({$<$}5Sct) in the same intervals, whereas these velocities for the USPC and normal stars are nearly identical. At least 50\% of the Am stars are spectroscopic binaries, half of which are double lined, whereas only 20\% of the USPC are known spectroscopic binaries. The 15 X Boo stars discussed here contain 8 young disk and 4 old disk stars, with 3 objects of unknown population because of radial velocity variations. Six young disk X Boo stars are members of the Hyades (3) or Sirius (3) supercluster. The age of the X Boo stars appears to be between 6 and 10X108 yr. The so-called ``A2 IV'' stars, labeled as possible peculiar objects by Abt (1994), may define the blue edge of the instability region. The USPC in the sample place the blue edge near log =3.904 for My {$>$}+0.75 mag. Four stars classified as USPC are considerably hotter than the blue edge and are probably a different type of object. The old disk (BS) stars constitute about one-quarter of the bright A-star sample in each of the stages\textemdash normal stars, Am stars, USPC, and X Boo stars. The spectroscopic binary frequency ranges from at least 50\% for the Am stars to less than 5\% for normal stars. This situation is the strongest argument for new birth as the origin of BS or, if rebirth, that whatever the required conditions they must mimic those for new birth. The strongest argument for rebirth as the origin of BS may be in the Am stars. Despite the fact that Am and USPC appear to be successive stages of evolution, separated by the blue edge of the instability region, and that at least a half-dozen USPC are also Am stars, the large difference in the apparent rotational velocity and large difference in the spectroscopic binary frequency makes such successive evolutionary stages seem unlikely. However, this very difficulty suggests the possibility that forward evolution for Am stars ends near the blue edge and coalescence or merger of the components ensues. \textcopyright{} 1995 American Astronomical Society.},

  abstract = {Context. Recent asteroseismic observations have led to the determination of rotational frequency splittings for = 1 mixed modes in red giants. Aims. We investigate how these observed splittings can constrain the modelling of the physical processes transporting angular momentum in stellar interiors. Methods. We first compare models including a comprehensive treatment of shellular rotation only, with the rotational splittings observed for the red giant KIC 8366239. We then study how these asteroseismic constraints can give us information about the efficiency of an additional mechanism for the internal transport of angular momentum. This is done by computing rotating models of KIC 8366239 that include a constant viscosity corresponding to this physical process, in addition to the treatment of shellular rotation. Results. We find that models of red giant stars including shellular rotation only predict steep rotation profiles, which are incompatible with the measurements of rotational splittings in the red giant KIC 8366239. Meridional circulation and shear mixing alone are found to produce an insufficient internal coupling so that an additional mechanism for the internal transport of angular momentum is needed during the post-main sequence evolution. We show that the viscosity {$\nu$}add corresponding to this mechanism is strongly constrained to be {$\nu$}add = 3 \texttimes{} 104 cm2 s-1 thanks to the observed ratio of the splittings for modes in the wings to those at the centre of the dipole forests. Such a value of viscosity may suggest that the same unknown physical process is at work during the main sequence and the post-main sequence evolution.},

  abstract = {The rotation-mass-age relationship offers a promising avenue for measuring the ages of field stars, assuming the attendant uncertainties to this technique can be well characterized. We model stellar angular momentum evolution starting with a rotation distribution from open cluster M37. Our predicted rotation-mass-age relationship shows significant zero-point offsets compared to an alternative angular momentum loss law and published gyrochronology relations. Systematic errors at the 30\% level are permitted by current data, highlighting the need for empirical guidance. We identify two fundamental sources of uncertainty that limit the precision of rotation-based ages and quantify their impact. Stars are born with a range of rotation rates, which leads to an age range at fixed rotation period. We find that the inherent ambiguity from the initial conditions is important for all young stars, and remains large for old stars below 0.6 M {$\Sun$}. Latitudinal surface differential rotation also introduces a minimum uncertainty into rotation period measurements and, by extension, rotation-based ages. Both models and the data from binary star systems 61 Cyg and {$\alpha$} Cen demonstrate that latitudinal differential rotation is the limiting factor for rotation-based age precision among old field stars, inducing uncertainties at the {$\sim$}2 Gyr level. We also examine the relationship between variability amplitude, rotation period, and age. Existing ground-based surveys can detect field populations with ages as old as 1-2 Gyr, while space missions can detect stars as old as the Galactic disk. In comparison with other techniques for measuring the ages of lower main sequence stars, including geometric parallax and asteroseismology, rotation-based ages have the potential to be the most precise chronometer for 0.6-1.0 M {$\Sun$} stars.},

  abstract = {Fundamental stellar properties, such as mass, radius, and age, can be inferred using asteroseismology. Cool stars with convective envelopes have turbulent motions that can stochastically drive and damp pulsations. The properties of the oscillation frequency power spectrum can be tied to mass and radius through solar-scaled asteroseismic relations. Stellar properties derived using these scaling relations need verification over a range of metallicities. Because the age and mass of halo stars are well-constrained by astrophysical priors, they provide an independent, empirical check on asteroseismic mass estimates in the low-metallicity regime. We identify nine metal-poor red giants (including six stars that are kinematically associated with the halo) from a sample observed by both the Kepler space telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III APOGEE spectroscopic survey. We compare masses inferred using asteroseismology to those expected for halo and thick-disk stars. Although our sample is small, standard scaling relations, combined with asteroseismic parameters from the APOKASC Catalog, produce masses that are systematically higher ( {$\Delta$}M = 0.17 {$\pm$} 0.05 M ) than astrophysical expectations. The magnitude of the mass discrepancy is reduced by known theoretical corrections to the measured large frequency separation scaling relationship. Using alternative methods for measuring asteroseismic parameters induces systematic shifts at the 0.04 M level. We also compare published asteroseismic analyses with scaling relationship masses to examine the impact of using the frequency of maximum power as a constraint. Upcoming APOKASC observations will provide a larger sample of {$\sim$}100 metal-poor stars, important for detailed asteroseismic characterization of Galactic stellar populations.},

However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

To follow this up, we obtained a month long series of observations of the fundamental mode Cepheid RT Aur and the first overtone pulsator SZ Tau. RT Aur shows the traditional strict repetition of the light curve, with the Fourier amplitude ratio R1/R2 remaining nearly constant. The light curve of SZ Tau, on the other hand, fluctuates in amplitude ratio at the level of approximately 50\%. Furthermore prewhitening the RT Aur data with 10 frequencies reduces the Fourier spectrum to noise. For SZ Tau, considerable power is left after this prewhitening in a complicated variety of frequencies.},

  abstract = {We present nine color CCD intermediate-band spectrophotometry of a two square degree field centered on the old open cluster M67, from 3890\$\textbackslash rm \AA\$ to nearly 1\$\textbackslash mu\$. These observations are taken as a part of the BATC (Beijing-Arizona-Taipei-Connecticut) Color Survey of the Sky, for both scientific and calibration reasons. With these data we show that the BATC survey can reach its goal of obtaining spectrophotometry to a zero point accuracy of 0.01 mag, and down to V = 21 with 0.3 mag random error. We fit the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) with Worthey's theoretical models. The net result is the excellent fit of the 4.0 Gyr, [Fe/H] = \$-0.10\$ model to our data, including a good fit to the main sequence (MS) turn-off. Our data are consistent with a toy model with 50\textbackslash\% of the stars in M67 being binaries and a random distribution of binary mass-ratios, although other models with different mass-ratio distributions cannot be ruled out. The spatial distribution and mass function (MF) of stars in M67 show marked effects of dynamical evolution and evaporation of stars from the cluster. Blue stragglers and binary stars are the most condensed within the cluster, with degree of condensation depending on mass.We find M67 to have an elongated shape, oriented at an angle of \$15\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ relative to the galactic plane. Within its tidal radius, the observed MF of M67 between 1.2 \$\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$ and \$\textbackslash rm 0.8 M\_\textbackslash odot\$ has a Salpeter slope \$\textbackslash rm \textbackslash eta = -1.93 \textbackslash pm 0.66\$. For stars of mass below 0.8 \$\textbackslash rm M\_\textbackslash odot\$, \$\textbackslash rm \textbackslash eta \textbackslash sim 0\$. It is plausible that the leveling-off of the MF at lower masses is a result of evaporation of lower mass stars in this mass range at a rate of one every \$\textbackslash sim 10\^7\$ years. If so, it is plausible that the IMF of M67 has the canonical field value of \$\textbackslash rm \textbackslash eta = -2.0\$.},

Observational data are drawn from high-quality surveys, including IR-array imaging, precise velocities, IR speckle interferometry, and visual imaging, and their respective incompleteness is determined. The number of companions per AU of semimajor axis is computed and found to decline monotonically toward larger semimajor axes. The period distribution exhibits a unimodal broad maximum with a peak in the range 9-220 yr, corresponding to separations of 3-30 AU, similar to that for G dwarf binaries. Fifty-eight percent of nearby M dwarf primaries are found to be single, and 42 +/- 9 percent have companions. The M-dwarf binary frequency is lower than that for G dwarfs (about 57 percent), owing partly to the smaller range of companion masses included, i.e., companions less massive than the M- or G-type primary.},

While the first parts of the pipeline extracted overall oscillation parameters of the stars, here we present a significant extension to that pipeline designed in order to extract individual mode frequencies and amplitudes. The pipeline also attempts to label the detected modes by straightening and then identifying the ridges within the echelle diagrams in an automated manner. Tests have been performed on artificial stars and the pipeline is shown to return estimates of the mode frequencies that are in line with the input parameters. There does appear to be some positive bias in the returned value of the mode amplitudes which must be accounted for when employing the pipeline for real data.},

We have reanalyzed this system using the full span of 3.5 years of Kepler photometric data, and obtained improved information about its star and the planets. A detailed asteroseismic analysis of the extended time series provides a significant improvement on the stellar parameters: not only can we state that Kepler-10 is the oldest known rocky-planet-harboring system at 10.41 {$\pm$} 1.36 Gyr, but these parameters combined with improved planetary parameters from new transit fits gives us the radius of Kepler-10b to within just 125 km. A new analysis of the full planetary phase curve leads to new estimates on the planetary temperature and albedo, which remain degenerate in the Kepler band. Our modeling suggests a deep occultation, which would imply that the nightside of this planet has a non-negligible temperature.},

The current state of the art for both observations and simulations is described, and we briefly mention directions for future research. The oldest GCs have ages greater than or equal to 12.5 Gyr and formed around the time of reionization. Resolved colour-magnitude diagrams of Milky Way GCs and direct imaging of lensed proto-GCs at z{$\sim$}6 with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) promise further insight. GCs are known to host multiple populations of stars with variations in their chemical abundances. Recently, such multiple populations have been detected in {$\sim$}2 Gyr old compact, massive star clusters. This suggests a common, single pathway for the formation of GCs at high and low redshift. The shape of the initial mass function for GCs remains unknown; however, for massive galaxies a power-law mass function is favoured. Significant progress has been made recently modelling GC formation in the context of galaxy formation, with success in reproducing many of the observed GC-galaxy scaling relations.},

Gaussian processes (GPs) are a popular class of models used for this purpose, but since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small data sets. In this paper, we present a novel method for GPs modeling in one dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the data set. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series data sets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillators\textemdash providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice\textemdash but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable GP methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

We detect a total of 251 periodicities, most in the g-mode domain, but some where pmodes occur, confirming that KIC 3527751 is a hybrid pulsator. We apply seismic tools to the periodicities to characterize the properties of KIC 3527751. Techniques to identify modes include asymptotic period spacing relationships, frequency multiplets, and the separation of multiplet splittings. These techniques allow for 189 (75\%) of the 251 periods to be associated with pulsation modes. Included in these are three sets of {$\mathscr{l}$} = 4 multiplets and possibly an {$\mathscr{l}$} = 9 multiplet. Period spacing sequences indicate {$\mathscr{l}$} = 1 and 2 overtone spacings of 266.4 {$\pm$} 0.2 and 153.2 {$\pm$} 0.2 s, respectively. We also calculate reduced periods, from which we find evidence of trapped pulsations. Such mode trappings can be used to constrain the core/atmosphere transition layers. Interestingly, frequency multiplets in the g-mode region, which sample deep into the star, indicate a rotation period of 42.6 {$\pm$} 3.4 days while p-mode multiplets, which sample the outer envelope, indicate a rotation period of 15.3 {$\pm$} 0.7 days. We interpret this as differential rotation in the radial direction with the core rotating more slowly. This is the first example of differential rotation for a sdB star.},

The mass of the RG in KIC 8410637 should therefore be similar to the mass of RGs in NGC 6819, thus lending support to the latest version of the asteroseismic scaling relations. This is the first direct measurement of both mass and radius for an RG to be compared with values for RGs from asteroseismic scaling relations thereby providing an accurate comparison. We find excellent agreement between log g values derived from the binary analysis and asteroseismic scaling relations. Conclusions. We have determined the masses and radii of the two stars in the binary accurately.

We summarize our method, the results, and the uncertainties, tabulate our revised distances, and give the implications of these results for cosmology. Our results are based on a Cepheid calibration of several secondary distance methods applied over the range of about 60-400 Mpc. The analysis presented here benefits from a number of recent improvements and refinements, including (1) a larger LMC Cepheid sample to define the fiducial period-luminosity (PL) relations, (2) a more recent HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) photometric calibration, (3) a correction for Cepheid metallicity, and (4) a correction for incompleteness bias in the observed Cepheid PL samples. We adopt a distance modulus to the LMC (relative to which the more distant galaxies are measured) of {$\mu$}0(LMC)=18.50+/-0.10 mag, or 50 kpc. New, revised distances are given for the 18 spiral galaxies for which Cepheids have been discovered as part of the Key Project, as well as for 13 additional galaxies with published Cepheid data. The new calibration results in a Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 in better agreement with the maser distance to this galaxy. Based on these revised Cepheid distances, we find values (in km s-1 Mpc-1) of H0=71+/-2 (random)+/-6 (systematic) (Type Ia supernovae), H0=71+/-3+/-7 (Tully-Fisher relation), H0=70+/-5+/-6 (surface brightness fluctuations), H0=72+/-9+/-7 (Type II supernovae), and H0=82+/-6+/-9 (fundamental plane). We combine these results for the different methods with three different weighting schemes, and find good agreement and consistency with H0=72+/-8 km s-1 Mpc-1. Finally, we compare these results with other, global methods for measuring H0.

The radial velocities of the older cluster systems are consistent with those expected from the reflex of solar motion and simple Galactic rotation. The cluster kinematics suggest strongly that they are drawn from the old thin disk stellar population. An abundance gradient in the Galactic disk of -0.09 +/- 0.02 dex/kpc is found. This gradient is in good agreement with that found for samples of younger open clusters, suggesting that there has been little change in the Galactic radial abundance gradient over time. The cluster sample shows no correlation between age and metallicity, regardless of Galactocentric radius. The clusters show an unexpected correlation between the Mg line strength and age of the cluster at a fixed metallicity. Possible reasons for this are discussed.},

  abstract = {We have begun a survey of the chemical and dynamical properties of the Milky Way disk as traced by open star clusters. In this first contribution, the general goals of our survey are outlined and the strengths and limitations of using star clusters as a Galactic disk tracer sample are discussed. We also present medium-resolution (R {$\sim$} 15, 0000) spectroscopy of open cluster stars obtained with the Hydra multi-object spectrographs on the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory 4 m and WIYN 3.5 m telescopes. Here we use these data to determine the radial velocities of 3436 stars in the fields of open clusters within about 3 kpc, with specific attention to stars having proper motions in the Tycho-2 catalog. Additional radial velocity members (without Tycho-2 proper motions) that can be used for future studies of these clusters were also identified. The radial velocities, proper motions, and the angular distance of the stars from cluster center are used to derive cluster membership probabilities for stars in each cluster field using a non-parametric approach, and the cluster members so identified are used, in turn, to derive the reliable bulk three-dimensional motion for 66 of 71 targeted open clusters. The high-probability cluster members that we identify help to clarify the color-magnitude sequences for many of the clusters, and are prime targets for future echelle resolution spectroscopy as well as astrometric study with the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM Planetquest).},

  abstract = {In clustered environments, stellar encounters can liberate planets from their host stars via close encounters. Although the detection probability of planets suggests that the planet population in open clusters resembles that in the field, only dozens of planet-hosting stars have been discovered in open clusters. We explore the survival rates of planets against stellar encounters in open clusters similar to the Pleiades, Hyades, and Praesepe and embedded clusters. We perform a series of N-body simulations of high-density and low-density open clusters, open clusters that grow via mergers of subclusters, and embedded clusters. We semi-analytically calculate the survival rate of planets in star clusters up to \textasciitilde 1 Gyr using relative velocities, masses, and impact parameters of intruding stars. Less than 1.5\% of close-in planets within 1 AU and at most 7\% of planets with 1--10 AU are ejected by stellar encounters in clustered environments after the dynamical evolution of star clusters. If a planet population from 0.01--100 AU in an open cluster initially follows the probability distribution function of exoplanets discovered in the field by RV surveys with semi-major axis (\$a\_\{\textbackslash rm p\}\$) between 0.03--3 AU (\$\textbackslash propto a\_\{\textbackslash rm p\}\^\{-0.6\}\$), the PDF of surviving planets beyond \textasciitilde 10 AU in open clusters follows \$\textbackslash propto a\_\{\textbackslash rm p\}\^\{-0.76\}\$, which is consistent with the result of direct-imaging surveys. The production rate of free-floating planets (FFPs) per star is 0.0096--0.18, where we assume that all the stars initially have one giant planet with a mass of 1--13 \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm Jup\}\$ in a circular orbit. The expected frequency of FFPs is compatible with the upper limit on that of FFPs indicated by recent microlensing surveys.},

Fortunately, eccentric binaries known as heartbeat stars often exhibit tidally excited oscillations, providing observable diagnostics of tidal circularization mechanisms and time-scales. We apply tidal theories to observations of the heartbeat star KIC 8164262, which contains an F-type primary in a very eccentric orbit that exhibits a prominent tidally excited oscillation. We demonstrate that the prominent oscillation is unlikely to result from a chance resonance between tidal forcing and a stellar oscillation mode. However, the oscillation has a frequency and amplitude consistent with the prediction of resonance locking, a mechanism in which coupled stellar and orbital evolution maintain a stable resonance between tidal forcing and a stellar oscillation mode. The resonantly excited mode produces efficient tidal dissipation (corresponding to an effective tidal quality factor Q {$\sim$} 5 \texttimes{} 104), such that tidal orbital decay/circularization proceeds on a stellar evolution time-scale.},

Some heartbeat stars exhibit tidally excited oscillations and present new opportunities for understanding the physics of tidal dissipation within stars. We present detailed methods to compute the forced amplitudes, frequencies and phases of tidally excited oscillations in eccentric binary systems. Our methods (i) factor out the equilibrium tide for easier comparison with observations, (ii) account for rotation using the traditional approximation, (iii) incorporate non-adiabatic effects to reliably compute surface luminosity perturbations, (iv) allow for spin\textendash orbit misalignment and (v) correctly sum over contributions from many oscillation modes. We also discuss why tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) are more visible in hot stars with surface temperatures T 6500 K, and we derive some basic probability theory that can be used to compare models with data in a statistical manner. Application of this theory to heartbeat systems can be used to determine whether observed TEOs can be explained by chance resonances with stellar oscillation modes, or whether a resonance locking process is operating.},

The hierarchical structure of a triple system produces tidal forcing at high frequencies unobtainable in binary systems, allowing for the tidal excitation of high frequency pmodes in the stellar components. The tidal forcing exists even for circular, aligned, and synchronized systems. We calculate the magnitude and frequencies of three body tidal forcing on the central primary star for circular and coplanar orbits, and we estimate the amplitude of the tidally excited oscillation modes. We also calculate the secular orbital changes induced by the tidally excited modes, and show that they can cause significant orbital decay. During certain phases of stellar evolution, the tidal dissipation may be greatly enhanced by resonance locking. We then compare our theory to observations of HD 181068, which is a hierarchical triply eclipsing star system in the Kepler field of view. The observed oscillation frequencies in HD 181068 can be naturally explained by three body tidal effects. We then compare the observed oscillation amplitudes and phases in HD 181068 to our predictions, finding mostly good agreement. Finally, we discuss the past and future evolution of compact triple systems like HD 181068.},

  abstract = {NASA's Kepler mission is providing basic asteroseismic data for hundreds of stars. One of the more common ways of determining stellar characteristics from these data is by the so-called grid-based modeling. We have made a detailed study of grid-based analysis techniques to study the errors (and error correlations) involved. As had been reported earlier, we find that it is relatively easy to get very precise values of stellar radii using grid-based techniques. However, we find that there are small, but significant, biases that can result because of the grid of models used. The biases can be minimized if metallicity is known. Masses cannot be determined as precisely as the radii and suffer from larger systematic effects. We also find that the errors in mass and radius are correlated. A positive consequence of this correlation is that log g can be determined both precisely and accurately with almost no systematic biases. Radii and log g can be determined with almost no model dependence to within 5\% for realistic estimates of errors in asteroseismic and conventional observations. Errors in mass can be somewhat higher unless accurate metallicity estimates are available. Age estimates of individual stars are the most model dependent. The errors are larger, too. However, we find that for star clusters, it is possible to get a relatively precise age if one assumes that all stars in a given cluster have the same age.},

  abstract = {Asteroseismology is a powerful tool for constraining stellar parameters. NASA's Kepler mission is providing individual eigenfrequencies for a huge number of stars, including thousands of red giants. Besides the frequencies of acoustic modes, an important breakthrough of the Kepler mission is the detection of nonradial gravitydominated mixed-mode oscillations in red giants. Unlike pure acoustic modes, mixed modes probe deeply into the interior of stars, allowing the stellar core properties and evolution of stars to be derived. In this work, using the gravity-mode period spacing and the large frequency separation, we construct the {$\Delta\Pi$}1\textendash{$\Delta\nu$} asteroseismic diagram from models of subgiants and red giants with various masses and metallicities. The relationship {$\Delta\Pi$}1\textendash{$\Delta\nu$} is able to constrain the ages and masses of the subgiants. Meanwhile, for red giants with masses above 1.5 Me, the {$\Delta\Pi$}1\textendash{$\Delta\nu$} asteroseismic diagram can also work well to constrain the stellar age and mass. Additionally, we calculate the relative ``isochrones'' {$\tau$}, which indicate similar evolution states especially for similar mass stars, on the {$\Delta\Pi$}1\textendash{$\Delta\nu$} diagram.},

In this paper, we have modeled the asteroseismic and spectroscopic data of the stars, and have determined their convection-zone helium abundances using the signatures left by the He II ionization zone on the mode frequencies. As expected, we find that the components of the binary are of the same age within uncertainties (3.087 {$\pm$} 0.580 Gyr and 3.569 {$\pm$} 0.912 Gyr); they also have the same initial helium abundance (Yinit=0.253 {$\pm$} 0.006 and 0.254 {$\pm$} 0.008). Their current metallicity ([Fe/H]=-0.275 {$\pm$} 0.04 and -0.285 {$\pm$} 0.04) is also the same within errors. Fits to the signature of the He II acoustic glitch yield current helium abundances of YA=0.224{$\pm$}0.006 and YB=0.233{$\pm$}0.008 for the two components. Analyzing the complete ensemble of models generated for this investigation, we find that both the amplitude and acoustic depth of the glitch signature arising from the second helium ionization zone and the base of the convection zone (CZ) are functions of mass. We show that the acoustic depths of these glitches are positively correlated with each other. The analysis can help us to detect the internal structure and constrain the chemical compositions.},

  abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the European Space Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page.},

  abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 2 provides high-precision astrometry and three-band photometry for about 1.3 billion sources over the full sky. The precision, accuracy, and homogeneity of both astrometry and photometry are unprecedented. Aims: We highlight the power of the Gaia DR2 in studying many fine structures of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Gaia allows us to present many different HRDs, depending in particular on stellar population selections. We do not aim here for completeness in terms of types of stars or stellar evolutionary aspects. Instead, we have chosen several illustrative examples. Methods: We describe some of the selections that can be made in Gaia DR2 to highlight the main structures of the Gaia HRDs. We select both field and cluster (open and globular) stars, compare the observations with previous classifications and with stellar evolutionary tracks, and we present variations of the Gaia HRD with age, metallicity, and kinematics. Late stages of stellar evolution such as hot subdwarfs, post-AGB stars, planetary nebulae, and white dwarfs are also analysed, as well as low-mass brown dwarf objects. Results: The Gaia HRDs are unprecedented in both precision and coverage of the various Milky Way stellar populations and stellar evolutionary phases. Many fine structures of the HRDs are presented. The clear split of the white dwarf sequence into hydrogen and helium white dwarfs is presented for the first time in an HRD. The relation between kinematics and the HRD is nicely illustrated. Two different populations in a classical kinematic selection of the halo are unambiguously identified in the HRD. Membership and mean parameters for a selected list of open clusters are provided. They allow drawing very detailed cluster sequences, highlighting fine structures, and providing extremely precise empirical isochrones that will lead to more insight in stellar physics. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 demonstrates the potential of combining precise astrometry and photometry for large samples for studies in stellar evolution and stellar population and opens an entire new area for HRD-based studies.

  abstract = {Methods. The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. Results. Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330\textendash 680 nm) and GRP (630\textendash 1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. Conclusions. Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

  abstract = {A key goal of the Kepler mission is the discovery of Earth-size transiting planets in "habitable zones" where stellar irradiance maintains a temperate climate on an Earth-like planet. Robust estimates of planet radius and irradiance require accurate stellar parameters, but most Kepler systems are faint, making spectroscopy difficult and prioritization of targets desirable. The parameters of 2035 host stars were estimated by Bayesian analysis and the probabilities p \textsubscript{HZ} that 2738 candidate or confirmed planets orbit in the habitable zone were calculated. Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program models were compared to photometry from the Kepler Input Catalog, priors for stellar mass, age, metallicity and distance, and planet transit duration. The analysis yielded probability density functions for calculating confidence intervals of planet radius and stellar irradiance, as well as p \textsubscript{HZ}. Sixty-two planets have p \textsubscript{HZ} \&gt; 0.5 and a most probable stellar irradiance within habitable zone limits. Fourteen of these have radii less than twice the Earth; the objects most resembling Earth in terms of radius and irradiance are KOIs 2626.01 and 3010.01, which orbit late K/M-type dwarf stars. The fraction of Kepler dwarf stars with Earth-size planets in the habitable zone ({$\eta$}\textsubscript{{$\oplus$}}) is 0.46, with a 95\% confidence interval of 0.31-0.64. Parallaxes from the Gaia mission will reduce uncertainties by more than a factor of five and permit definitive assignments of transiting planets to the habitable zones of Kepler stars.},

  abstract = {Astrometric noise in excess of parallax and proper motion could be a signature of orbital wobble of individual components in binary star systems. The combination of X-ray selection with astrometric noise can then be a powerful tool for identifying accreting binaries. Here, we mine the Gaia DR2 catalogue for Galactic sources with significant values of astrometric noise over the parameter space expected for known and candidate X-ray binaries (XRBs). Cross-matching our sample with the Chandra Source Catalogue CSC2.0 returns a primary sample of \textasciitilde 1,500 X-ray sources with significant excess noise, constituting \textasciitilde 0.04\% of the initial Gaia sample. By contrast, the fraction of matched X-ray sources in a control sample with smaller excess noise is a factor of about 7 lower. The primary sample branches off the main sequence much more than control objects in colour-mag space, shows a distinct spatial distribution in terms of Galactic latitudes, comprises more objects with an Halpha excess and larger X-ray-to-optical flux ratios, and includes a higher fraction of known binaries, variables and young stellar object class types. However, for individual XRBs with known system parameters, excess noise can exceed expectations, especially for small wobble. It is likely that other factors (possibly attitude and modelling uncertainties, as well as source variability) currently dominate the observed noise in such systems. Confirmation must therefore await future Gaia releases. The full Chandra/Gaia matched catalogue is released here to enable legacy follow-up.},

  abstract = {We report on a first census of Galactic black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) properties with the second data release (DR2) of \{\textbackslash em Gaia\}, focusing on dynamically confirmed and strong candidate black hole transients. DR2 provides five-parameter astrometric solutions including position, parallax and proper motion for 11 of a sample of 24 systems. Distance estimates are tested with parallax inversion as well as Bayesian inference. We derive an empirically motivated characteristic scale length of \$L\$=2.17\$\textbackslash pm\$0.12 kpc for this BHXRB population to infer distances based upon an exponentially decreasing space density prior. Geometric DR2 parallaxes provide new, independent distance estimates, but the faintness of this population in quiescence results in relatively large fractional distance uncertainties. Despite this, DR2 estimates generally agree with literature distances. The most discrepant case is BW Cir, for which detailed studies of the donor star have suggested a distant location at \$\textbackslash sim\$25 kpc. A large DR2 measured parallax and relatively high proper motion instead prefer significantly smaller distances, suggesting that the source may instead be amongst the nearest of XRBs. However, both distances create problems for interpretation of the source, and follow-up data are required to resolve its true nature. DR2 also provides a first distance estimate to one source, MAXI J1820+070, and novel proper motion estimates for 7 sources. Peculiar velocities relative to Galactic rotation exceed \$\textbackslash approx\$50 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ for the bulk of the sample, with a median system kinetic energy of peculiar motion of \$\textbackslash sim\$5\$\textbackslash times\$10\$\^\{47\}\$erg. BW Cir could be a new high-velocity BHXRB if its astrometry is confirmed. A putative anti-correlation between system kinetic energy and black hole mass is found, though not yet constrained enough to distinguish BH formation channels.},

The distance modulus of the cluster is determined to be (m - M)0 = 11.86 {$\pm$} 0.05 mag (2355 {$\pm$} 54 pc), which is quite consistent with published values.

We find evidence for the presence of mass segregation in the cluster. Among the likely cluster members, we identify six blue subdwarfs, 43 blue stragglers, and 27 red clump giants. We find that 34 blue stragglers ({$\sim$}79\%) lie within the core radius ({$<$}3.69{${'}\$\lbrace<\rbrace$}3.69\^\{\textbackslash prime \}\$) of the cluster, indicating that these stars may be formed by star collisions or by the evolution of primordial binaries within the dense core. The 27 red clump giants are used to accurately estimate the distance of the cluster. We determine a distance of 4118 {$\pm$} 23~pc for the cluster using a Monte-Carlo simulation method.

The RF method is used to calculate membership probabilities of 71,117 stars within 2.\textdegree 5 of the cluster center in an 11-dimensional parameter space, the photometric data are also taken into account. Based on the RF membership probabilities, we obtain 1502 likely cluster members ({$\geq$}0.6), 1361 of which are high-probability cluster members ({$\geq$}0.8). Based on high-probability memberships with high-precision astrometric data, the mean parallax (distance) and proper-motion of the cluster are determined to be 1.1327 {$\pm$} 0.0018 mas (883 {$\pm$} 1 pc) and ({$<$} \{{$\mu$} \}{$\alpha$} \textbackslash cos {$\delta$} {$>$} , {$<$} \{{$\mu$} \}{$\delta$} {$>$} ) = (-10.9378 {$\pm$}0.0078, -2.9465 {$\pm$} 0.0074) mas yr-1, respectively. We find the cluster to have a mean radial velocity of +34.06 {$\pm$}0.09 km s-1, using 74 high-probability cluster members with precise radial-velocity measures. We investigate the spatial structure of the cluster, the core and limiting radius are determined to be 4.-80 {$\pm$} 0.-11 ({$\sim$}1.23 {$\pm$} 0.03 pc) and 61.-98 {$\pm$} 1.-50 ({$\sim$}15.92 {$\pm$} 0.39 pc), respectively. Our results reveal that an escaped member with high membership probability ({$\sim$}0.91) is located at a distance of 77- ({$\sim$}20 pc) from the cluster center. Furthermore, our results reveal that at least 26.4\% of the main-sequence stars in M67 are binary stars. We confirm that significant mass segregation has taken place within M67.},

As a benchmark, we select 40318 stars in the field of the open cluster NGC 6405 from the Gaia Data Release 2 ( Gaia -DR2) by means of all five astrometric (positions, proper motions, and parallax) and photometric parameters. We use this combined method to determine likely cluster members in an eleven-dimensional parameter space. A total number of 518 high-probability ({$\geq$}0.6) memberships are obtained, and the mean parallax and proper motion of the cluster are determined to be 2.171 {$\pm$} 0.005 mas (461 {$\pm$} 1 pc) and ( \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/156/3/121/ajaad690ieqn1.gif] \$\textbackslash langle \textbackslash mu \_\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash cos \textbackslash delta \textbackslash rangle ,\textbackslash langle \textbackslash mu \_\textbackslash delta \textbackslash rangle \$ ) = (-1.357 {$\pm$} 0.023,-5.823 {$\pm$} 0.020) mas yr -1 , respectively.

This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in segregating likely cluster members of open clusters in high-noise environments. We use the GMM method to segregate likely cluster members of four low Galactic latitude open clusters: NGC 2112, NGC 2477, NGC 7789, and Collinder 261, based on the high-precision astrometric data of the Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia-DR2). The GMM method is used to calculate the membership probabilities of the stars in the field of each cluster; five astrometric parameters (positions, parallaxes, and proper motions) are taken into account. We quantitatively evaluate the goodness of the cluster-field segregation for each cluster, and find that the GMM method is effective for segregating likely cluster members of these clusters, even if these clusters suffer from heavy field star contamination. We estimate the distances and absolute proper motions of these clusters using reliable cluster members; our results suggest the existence of a significant zero-point offset in Gaia-DR2 parallaxes.

This method combines two widely used algorithms: spectral clustering (SC) and random forest (RF). The former one is used to construct a reliable training set, the membership probabilities are calculated based on the latter one. This method only depends on reliable training set, no prior knowledge about the cluster is needed. This method is based on the basic assumption that most if not all the information about the cluster members and field stars are contained in a reliable training set, this makes it highly suitable for handling high-dimensional data sets. We use this method to investigate the likely memberships of the old open cluster NGC 188 based on the high-precision astrometry and photometry from the it\{Gaia\} Data Release 2 (it\{Gaia\} DR2). Based on seven-dimensional features (positions, parallax, proper motions and color-magnitude) of 3780 sample stars in the region of NGC 188, 645 likely members with high membership probabilities ({$\geq$} 0.75) are obtained. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our membership determination.

Based on the stars with high membership probabilities, we have derived the radial velocity and metal abundance of the cluster to be respectively Vr =-46.4{$\pm$}0.2 km{$\cdot$}s-1 and [Fe/H]=0.32{$\pm$}0.11dex, in good agreement with the results obtained by other authors on the basis of high-resolution spectroscopy. Using red clump giants in the cluster as ``standard candle'', we have derived the absolute distance modulus of the cluster to be (m - M)0 =13.02{$\pm$}0.08mag or 4.02{$\pm$}0.15 kpc in distance, consistent with the values obtained from main-sequence fittings by some authors. And our main conclusions are: (1) NGC 6791 is extremely metal-rich; (2) Within the spectral resolution of SDSS, the discriminated 87 cluster members have no evident difference in matallicity; (3) The obtained distance modulus is insensitive to the age, metallicity and dust distinction, so it is a kind of reliable indirect measurement.},

These stochastically excited and intrinsically damped oscillations were first detected in the Sun (Leighton et al., 1962), and hence are commonly known as solar-like oscillations.Oscillation modes can be characterized by the number of nodes, n, in the radial direction, called the radial order, and a non-radial part described by spherical harmonics, each with an angular degree, l, which equals the number of nodal lines on the surface, and an azimuthal order, m, which is the number of those nodal lines crossing the equator of the star. Except for the Sun, we can generally not resolve these oscillations on the surfaces of cool stars and so the surface displacements of modes with high angular degree (l {$\greaterequivlnt$} 4) cannot be observed because regions of opposite phase tend to cancel out.When stars grow old and the supply of hydrogen fuel is exhausted in the core, their envelopes expand and cool: they become sub giants and eventually red giants. This transition is shown in the so-called HR diagram in Figure 11.1, which indicates the main stages of evolution of a one solar mass star from the ``main sequence'' where the Sun is currently located (between points 1 and 2) through to the red giant phase discussed in this chapter (beyond point 3).},

  abstract = {Until the last few decades, investigations of stellar interiors had been restricted to theoretical studies only constrained by observations of their global properties and external characteristics. However, in the last 30 years the field has been revolutionized by the ability to perform seismic investigations of stellar interiors. This revolution begun with the Sun, where helioseismology has been yielding information competing with what can be inferred about the Earth's interior from geoseismology. The last two decades have witnessed the advent of asteroseismology of solar-like stars, thanks to a dramatic development of new observing facilities providing the first reliable results on the interiors of distant stars. The coming years will see a huge development in this field. In this review we focus on solar-type stars, i.e., cool main-sequence stars where oscillations are stochastically excited by surface convection. After a short introduction and a historical overview of the discipline, we review the observational techniques generally used, and we describe the theory behind stellar oscillations in cool main-sequence stars. We continue with a complete description of the normal mode analyses through which it is possible to extract the physical information about the structure and dynamics of the stars. We then summarize the lessons that we have learned and discuss unsolved issues and questions that are still unanswered.},

  abstract = {Kepler ultra-high precision photometry of long and continuous observations provides a unique dataset in which surface rotation and variability can be studied for thousands of stars. Because many of these old field stars also have independently measured asteroseismic ages, measurements of rotation and activity are particularly interesting in the context of age-rotation-activity relations. In particular, age-rotation relations generally lack good calibrators at old ages, a problem that this Kepler sample of old-field stars is uniquely suited to address. We study the surface rotation and photometric magnetic activity of a subset of 540 solar-like stars on the mainsequence and the subgiant branch for which stellar pulsations have been measured. The rotation period was determined by comparing the results from two different analysis methods: i) the projection onto the frequency domain of the time-period analysis, and ii) the autocorrelation function of the light curves. Reliable surface rotation rates were then extracted by comparing the results from two different sets of calibrated data and from the two complementary analyses. General photometric levels of magnetic activity in this sample of stars were also extracted by using a photometric activity index, which takes into account the rotation period of the stars. We report rotation periods for 310 out of 540 targets (excluding known binaries and candidate planet-host stars); our measurements span a range of 1 to 100 days. The photometric magnetic activity levels of these stars were computed, and for 61.5\% of the dwarfs, this level is similar to the range, from minimum to maximum, of the solar magnetic activity. We demonstrate that hot dwarfs, cool dwarfs, and subgiants have very different rotation-age relationships, highlighting the importance of separating out distinct populations when interpreting stellar rotation periods. Our sample of cool dwarf stars with age and metallicity data of the highest quality is consistent with gyrochronology relations reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {Space observatories such as Kepler have provided data that can potentially revolutionize our understanding of stars. Through detailed asteroseismic analyses we are capable of determining fundamental stellar parameters and reveal the stellar internal structure with unprecedented accuracy. However, such detailed analyses, known as peak bagging, have so far been obtained for only a small percentage of the observed stars while most of the scientific potential of the available data remains unexplored. One of the major challenges in peak bagging is identifying how many solar-like oscillation modes are visible in a power density spectrum. Identification of oscillation modes is usually done by visual inspection that is time-consuming and has a degree of subjectivity. Here, we present a peak-detection algorithm especially suited for the detection of solar-like oscillations. It reliably characterizes the solar-like oscillations in a power density spectrum and estimates their parameters without human intervention. Furthermore, we provide a metric to characterize the false positive and false negative rates to provide further information about the reliability of a detected oscillation mode or the significance of a lack of detected oscillation modes. The algorithm presented here opens the possibility for detailed and automated peak bagging of the thousands of solar-like oscillators observed by Kepler.},

We then discussed different scenarios that could contribute to reducing the dipole amplitudes, such as a fast-rotating interior or the effect of a magnetic field on the properties of the modes. We also performed a detailed study of the inertia and damping of the modes. Results. We have been able to characterise 36 oscillations modes, in particular, a few dipole modes above {$\nu$}max that exhibit nearly normal amplitudes. The frequencies of all the measured modes were used to determine the overall properties and the internal structure of the star. We have inferred a surface rotation period of {$\sim$}91 days and uncovered a variation in the surface magnetic activity during the last 4 years. The analysis of the convective background did not reveal any difference compared to ``normal'' red giants. As expected, the internal regions of the star probed by the = 2 and 3 modes spin 4 to 8 times faster than the surface. Conclusions. With our grid of standard models we are able to properly fit the observed frequencies. Our model calculation of mode inertia and damping give no explanation for the depressed dipole modes. A fast-rotating core is also ruled out as a possible explanation. Finally, we do not have any observational evidence of a strong deep magnetic field inside the star.},

Follow-up spectroscopy indicates that (1) at least 12 of these red-giant branch (RGB) candidates are bona fide cluster members, and (2) their metallicity, as estimated from the strength of the Ca II infrared triplet lines, is slightly above solar. If the core helium-burning (`clump') stars in NGC 6791 have a mean MV = 0.9, which is the current best estimate for that of their counterparts in the (M/H) approximately equal to 0.0 cluster M67, then the apparent distance modulus of the former is near (m - M)V approximately equal to 13.6. This would imply an age of about 9 Gyr, from appropriate stellar models, versus approximately equal to 4.5 Gyr for M67. Importantly, with this estimate of the distance -- which is unlikely to be in error by more than +/- 0.25 mag -- the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of NGC 6791 intimates that its RGB does not rise above MI approximately -2.7. In contrast, the RGBs of all Galactic globular clusters with metallicities of one-quarter solar or less are presently believed to reach MI approximately equal to -4.0, though fainter tip magnitudes have been inferred for the very few globulars of higher metal abundance (e.g., NGC 6553) that have been studied. If the tip MI value does not vary with metallicity among (at least) the most metal-rich systems, then that variation can be expected to affect, e.g., estimates of the extragalactic distance scale based on the `surface brightness fluctuation' method. Consequently, NGC 6791 provides an exceedingly important constraint on our understanding of old, metal-rich stellar populations. Encouragingly, theoretical evolutionary tracks whose temperatures and colors are consistent with various empirical constraints appear to provide a fine match to the upper CMD of NGC 6791, if the cluster metallicity is (M/H) greater than 0.0.},

  abstract = {Red giant stars are proving to be an incredible source of information for testing models of stellar evolution, as asteroseismology has opened up a window into their interiors. Such insights are a direct result of the unprecedented data from space missions CoRoT and Kepler as well as recent theoretical advances. Eclipsing binaries are also fundamental astrophysical objects, and when coupled with asteroseismology, binaries provide two independent methods to obtain masses and radii and exciting opportunities to develop highly constrained stellar models. The possibility of discovering pulsating red giants in eclipsing binary systems is therefore an important goal that could potentially offer very robust characterization of these systems. Until recently, only one case has been discovered with Kepler. We cross-correlate the detected red giant and eclipsing-binary catalogs from Kepler data to find possible candidate systems. Light-curve modeling and mean properties measured from asteroseismology are combined to yield specific measurements of periods, masses, radii, temperatures, eclipse timing variations, core rotation rates, and red giant evolutionary state. After using three different techniques to eliminate false positives, out of the 70 systems common to the red giant and eclipsing-binary catalogs we find 13 strong candidates (12 previously unknown) to be eclipsing binaries, one to be a non-eclipsing binary with tidally induced oscillations, and 10 more to be hierarchical triple systems, all of which include a pulsating red giant. The systems span a range of orbital eccentricities, periods, and spectral types F, G, K, and M for the companion of the red giant. One case even suggests an eclipsing binary composed of two red giant stars and another of a red giant with a {$\delta$}-Scuti star. The discovery of multiple pulsating red giants in eclipsing binaries provides an exciting test bed for precise astrophysical modeling, and follow-up spectroscopic observations of many of the candidate systems are encouraged. The resulting highly constrained stellar parameters will allow, for example, the exploration of how binary tidal interactions affect pulsations when compared to the single-star case.},

A careful analysis of the corresponding Kepler light curves shows that modes with amplitudes that are usually observed in red giants would have been detected if they were present. We observe that mode depletion is strongly associated with shortperiod systems, in which stellar radii account for 16\%\textendash 24\% of the semi-major axis, and where red-giant surface activity is detected. We suggest that when the rotational and orbital periods synchronize in close binaries, the red-giant component is spun up, so that a dynamo mechanism starts and generates a magnetic field, leading to observable stellar activity. Pressure modes would then be damped as acoustic waves dissipate in these fields.},

From several powerful validation techniques, all indications so far show that stellar radius estimates from the asteroseismic scaling relations are accurate to within a few percent. Eclipsing binary systems hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like oscillations constitute the ideal test objects for validating asteroseismic radius and mass inferences. By combining radial velocity (RV) measurements and photometric time series of eclipses, it is possible to determine the masses and radii of each component of a double-lined spectroscopic binary. We report the results of a four-year RV survey performed with the \'echelle spectrometer of the Astrophysical Research Consortium's 3.5 m telescope and the APOGEE spectrometer at Apache Point Observatory. We compare the masses and radii of 10 red giants (RGs) obtained by combining radial velocities and eclipse photometry with the estimates from the asteroseismic scaling relations. We find that the asteroseismic scaling relations overestimate RG radii by about 5\% on average and masses by about 15\% for stars at various stages of RG evolution. Systematic overestimation of mass leads to underestimation of stellar age, which can have important implications for ensemble asteroseismology used for Galactic studies. As part of a second objective, where asteroseismology is used for understanding binary systems, we confirm that oscillations of RGs in close binaries can be suppressed enough to be undetectable, ahypothesis that was proposed in a previous work.},

Mixed modes with the same azimuthal order are expected to be almost equally spaced in stretched period, with a spacing equal to the pure dipole gravity mode period spacing. The departure from this regular pattern allows us to disentangle the various rotational components and therefore to determine the mean core rotation rates of red giants. Results. We automatically identify the rotational multiplet components of 1183 stars on the red giant branch with a success rate of 69\% with respect to our initial sample. As no information on the internal rotation can be deduced for stars seen pole-on, we obtain mean core rotation measurements for 875 red giant branch stars. This large sample includes stars with a mass as large as 2.5 M , allowing us to test the dependence of the core slow-down rate on the stellar mass. Conclusions. Disentangling rotational splittings from mixed modes is now possible in an automated way for stars on the red giant branch, even for the most complicated cases, where the rotational splittings exceed half the mixed-mode spacing. This work on a large sample allows us to refine previous measurements of the evolution of the mean core rotation on the red giant branch. Rather than a slight slow-down, our results suggest rotation is constant along the red giant branch, with values independent of the mass.},

  abstract = {Kepler-454 (KOI-273) is a relatively bright (V = 11.69 mag), Sun-like star that hosts a transiting planet candidate in a 10.6 day orbit. From spectroscopy, we estimate the stellar temperature to be 5687{$\pm$}50 K, its metallicity to be [m/H] = 0.32{$\pm$}0.08, and the projected rotational velocity to be v sin i{$<$}2.4 km s-1. We combine these values with a study of the asteroseismic frequencies from short cadence Kepler data to estimate the stellar mass to be 1.028-+00..0034M, the radius to be 1.066{$\pm$}0.012 Re, and the age to be 5.25-+11..3491 Gyr. We estimate the radius of the 10.6 day planet as 2.37{$\pm$}0.13 R{$\oplus$}. Using 63 radial velocity observations obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo and 36 observations made with the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we measure the mass of this planet to be 6.8{$\pm$}1.4 M{$\oplus$}. We also detect two additional nontransiting companions, a planet with a minimum mass of 4.46{$\pm$}0.12 MJ in a nearly circular 524 day orbit and a massive companion with a period {$>$}10 years and mass {$>$}12.1 MJ. The 12 exoplanets with radii {$<$}2.7 R{$\oplus$} and precise mass measurements appear to fall into two populations, with those {$<$}1.6 R{$\oplus$} following an Earth-like composition curve and larger planets requiring a significant fraction of volatiles. With a density of 2.76{$\pm$}0.73 g cm-3, Kepler-454b lies near the mass transition between these two populations and requires the presence of volatiles and/or H/He gas.},

As survey astronomy continues to grow, the size and complexity of astronomical databases will increase, and the ability of astronomers to manually scour data and make such discoveries decreases. In this work, we introduce a machine learning-based method to identify anomalies in large datasets to facilitate such discoveries, and apply this method to long cadence lightcurves from NASA's Kepler Mission. Our method clusters data based on density, identifying anomalies as data that lie outside of dense regions. This work serves as a proof-of-concept case study and we test our method on four quarters of the Kepler long cadence lightcurves. We use Kepler's most notorious anomaly, Boyajian's Star (KIC 8462852), as a rare `ground truth' for testing outlier identification to verify that objects of genuine scientific interest are included among the identified anomalies. We evaluate the method's ability to identify known anomalies by identifying unusual behavior in Boyajian's Star, we report the full list of identified anomalies for these quarters, and present a sample subset of identified outliers that includes unusual phenomena, objects that are rare in the Kepler field, and data artifacts. By identifying {$<$}4\% of each quarter as outlying data, we demonstrate that this anomaly detection method can create a more targeted approach in searching for rare and novel phenomena.},

  abstract = {The primary science goal of the Kepler Mission is to detect planets in the habitable zones of their host stars where liquid water could exist on the planet surface, and to determine the intrinsic frequency of these and other exoplanets. The technique employed by Kepler is to search for shallow transits, that in the case of a true Earth analog would be 85 parts per million deep, lasting an average of 10 hours, and happening once per year. This combination of small, short, and rare events drives mission development and operations to support ultra-high precision photometry on one field of 150,000 largely solar-like stars with nearly continuous exposures covering at least 3.5 years. Since the transit depth returns only the size of a candidate planet relative to the size of its host star, fulfillment of an additional Kepler science goal of determining physical properties of the discovered planets requires us to also determine stellar properties, with stellar radius being the most important. For the latter asteroseismology is a particularly important tool that allows stellar radii to be determined to \texttildelow 1\% in favorable cases. The Kepler asteroseismology program is organized into a large international collaboration - the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium consisting of a dozen working groups and some 300 members. The observations to date in the area of cool giant stars consist of 30 minute integrations for some 1,200 stars spanning a full year. For cool dwarfs the observations to date using 1 minute integrations aimed at asteroseismology consist of three types: (1) A few thousand stars observed for one month each in a "survey" mode to identify the best prospects for lengthier observations. (2) About 200 stars hosting planet candidates observed for periods now reaching up to a year for which asteroseismology is desired whenever possible. (3) A set of about 100 stars for which much more extended observations are possible that have been selected purely on the basis of asteroseismic interest. The red giants have typical magnitudes of about 12th, with a couple of hundred selected at brighter magnitudes. In nearly all cases the astrophysical signatures of oscillations and granulation dominate noise sources. Cool dwarfs studied for asteroseismology range from 16 Cyg A and B near 6th magnitude, to planet host stars of 13th magnitude for which extensive observations may allow detection of at least the asteroseismic large separation to constrain the stellar mean density and hence radius. I review the target selections, the instrumental capabilities relevant for cool-star asteroseismology, and the basic approaches and promises of asteroseismology. Emphasis is given to reviewing the extensive new returns from the Kepler Mission that are providing new insights into cool dwarfs and giants from asteroseismic analyses.},

The technical requirements for conducting asteroseismology include ultrahigh precision measured in photometry in parts per million, as well as nearly continuous time series over weeks to years, and cadences rapid enough to sample oscillations with periods as short as a few minutes. We report on results from the first 43 days of observations, in which the unique capabilities of Kepler in providing a revolutionary advance in asteroseismology are already well in evidence.

Characteristics of these data will be described. An application of asteroseismology in support of the core Kepler mission of characterizing detected planets follows from stellar radius determinations needed to in turn provide radii for the planets. The steps from processing of Kepler short cadence data, derivation of asteroseismic frequencies from power spectra of these time series, constraint on the mean stellar density and ultimately stellar radius will be illustrated for a few planet host stars yielding radii to accuracies approaching 1\%. Analysis of individual oscillation frequencies will provide information about the properties of stellar interiors, resulting in some cases in determinations of ages to about 10\%. Asteroseismic results will ultimately be expected for several thousand stars ranging from the solar analog oscillations mentioned above, to oscillations in red giants and a full spectrum of classical variable stars (both at short, and the 30-minute long cadence) including delta Scuti, RR Lyrae, RoAp stars etc. Kepler was selected as the 10th mission of the Discovery Program.

  abstract = {Kepler mission results are rapidly contributing to fundamentally new discoveries in both the exoplanet and asteroseismology fields. The data returned from Kepler are unique in terms of the number of stars observed, precision of photometry for time series observations, and the temporal extent of high duty cycle observations. As the first mission to provide extensive time series measurements on thousands of stars over months to years at a level hitherto possible only for the Sun, the results from Kepler will vastly increase our knowledge of stellar variability for quiet solar-type stars. Here, we report on the stellar noise inferred on the timescale of a few hours of most interest for detection of exoplanets via transits. By design the data from moderately bright Kepler stars are expected to have roughly comparable levels of noise intrinsic to the stars and arising from a combination of fundamental limitations such as Poisson statistics and any instrument noise. The noise levels attained by Kepler on-orbit exceed by some 50\% the target levels for solar-type, quiet stars. We provide a decomposition of observed noise for an ensemble of 12th magnitude stars arising from fundamental terms (Poisson and readout noise), added noise due to the instrument and that intrinsic to the stars. The largest factor in the modestly higher than anticipated noise follows from intrinsic stellar noise. We show that using stellar parameters from galactic stellar synthesis models, and projections to stellar rotation, activity, and hence noise levels reproduce the primary intrinsic stellar noise features.},

Spectroscopy of the star coupled with asteroseismic modeling of the multiple pulsation modes yield precise measurements of stellar properties, notably Teff = 5793 {$\pm$} 74 K, M = 1.079 {$\pm$} 0.051 M , R = 1.243 {$\pm$} 0.019 R , and {$\rho$} = 0.7903 {$\pm$} 0.0054 g cm-3, all measured with fractional uncertainties of only a few percent. Models of Kepler-68b suggest that it is likely composed of rock and water, or has a H and He envelope to yield its density {$\sim$}3 g cm-3.},

  abstract = {Six SX Phe variables detected in a 39 hr time series of Hubble Space Telescope Planetary Camera exposures in the F336W (U) filter are discussed. Two of these stars show both the fundamental and first-overtone modes and are among the first double-mode SX Phe stars reported in globular clusters. One of the double-mode stars shows evidence for a third mode near the expected period for the second overtone. Two of the other SX Phe variables in 47 Tuc are shown to oscillate simultaneously in the fourth and fifth radial overtones. The remaining two variables both have multiple oscillations excited which include nonradial modes. To support interpretation of these variables we provide evolutionary computations using current opacities and physics allowing comparison of the blue straggler stars (BSSs) and several cluster-magnitude diagram features for 47 Tuc. Linear nonadiabatic oscillation analysis is performed for a significant range of envelope and full evolutionary models in order to (1) establish the theoretical characteristics of SX Phe pulsations (e.g., location of primary driving and adiabatic nature), (2) establish the theoretical red and blue edges of the instability strip, and (3) derive the theoretical relations necessary for obtaining evolutionary and pulsational masses. Masses inferred from fundamental period-period ratio relations for the double-mode oscillators are well above the turnoff mass in 47 Tucanae and are consistent with expected masses for these blue stragglers based on position in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and comparison with theoretical evolutionary tracks. Combining the evolution and pulsation constraints results in mass estimates for the four double-mode BSSs in 47 Tuc of M = 1.35 +/- 0.1 to 1.6 +/- 0.2 M{$\odot$}.

The observations were obtained while 47 Tuc was in the continuous viewing zone (CVZ) of HST. This data set provides an unparalleled sensitivity for quantification of stellar variability: (1) in the blue straggler population, {$\delta$} Scuti oscillations would provide important constraints on these enigmatic stars; (2) studies of cataclysmic variables detectable through dwarf novae outbursts or orbital modulation are of interest in testing formation theories; (3) eclipsing binaries and W UMa systems are of fundamental interest for cluster dynamics considerations. In this paper the unique data analysis challenges posed in following some 20,000 (undersampled PSF cores with extended spherical aberration induced halos) stars with near-Poisson limited precisions given the complications of image motion and a high rate of cosmic rays are addressed in detail.

This feature has given rise to a series of methods aimed at measuring the distributions of stellar distances and extinctions, especially in the Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way Bulge. Because the RC is easily recognizable within the data of large spectroscopic and asteroseismic surveys, it is a useful probe of stellar densities, kinematics, and chemical abundances across the Milky Way disk; it can be applied up to larger distances than that allowed by dwarfs; and it has better accuracy than is possible with other kinds of giants. Here, we discuss the reasons for the RC narrowness in several sets of observational data, its fine structure, and the presence of systematic changes in the RC properties as regards age, metallicity, and the observed passband. These factors set the limits on the validity and accuracy of several RC methods defined in the literature.},

This is the main difference between our implementation of the IRFM and that of Ram\'irez \&amp; Mel\'endez (2005, ApJ, 626, 446, hereafter RM05), since to introduce new stars at the lowest metallicities they transform the 2MASS JHK\textsubscript{s} magnitudes into the TCS photometric system. We merge in our sample the stars from Alonso et al. (1996, A\&amp;AS, 117, 227, hereafter AAM96; 1999, A\&amp;AS, 139, 335, hereafter AAM99), and other studies to appropriately cover a wide range of metallicities, ending up with 555 dwarf and subgiant field stars and 264 giant field stars. We derived a new bolometric flux calibration using the available Johnson-Cousins UBV(RI)\textsubscript{C} and the 2MASS JHK\textsubscript{s} photometry. We also computed new T\_eff versus colour empirical calibrations using our extended sample of stars. {$<$}BR /{$>$}Results: We derived effectives temperatures for almost all the stars in the AAM96 and AAM99 samples and find that our scales of temperature are hotter by{\~ } \vphantom\{\}64 K ({$\sigma\_$}T=104 K, N=332 dwarfs) and {\~\{}54 K with a {$\sigma\_$}T=131 K (N=202 giants).

We have performed an fully self-consistent IRFM in the 2MASS photometric system. For those who wish to use 2MASS photometry and colour-temperature calibrations to derive effective temperatures, especially for metal-poor stars, we recommend our calibrations over others available in the literature. In our implementation we avoid the transformation of the 2MASS \{JHK\}\textsubscript{s} magnitudes to a different photometric system and thus fully exploit the excellent internal consistency of the 2MASS photometric system. {$<$}P /{$>$}Tables as described in Sect. 3 are only available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/497/497 {$<$}P /{$>$}},

We implement a multi-wavelength approach to studying the X-ray sources, utilizing X-ray and UV data from XMM observations along with the wealth of photometry and radial-velocity data from the WIYN Open Cluster Study and the CFHT Open Cluster Survey. Within the cluster half-light radius, we detect 12 X-ray sources down to a luminosity of 1030 erg s-1 for cluster members. The sources include a candidate quiescent low-mass X-ray binary (qLMXB), a candidate cataclysmic variable, and two active binary systems. The presence of a qLMXB in an open cluster is previously unexpected given the known relationships between luminous X-ray sources and encounter frequency in globular clusters, and most likely has a dynamical origin.},

  abstract = {Photon-limited transit surveys in the V band are in principle about 20 times more sensitive to planets of fixed size in the habitable zone around M stars than G stars. In the I band the ratio is about 400. The advantages of a closer habitable zone and smaller stars (together with the numerical superiority of M stars) more than compensate for the reduced signal because of the lower luminosity of the later-type stars. That is, M stars can yield reliable transit detections at much fainter apparent magnitudes than G stars. However, to achieve this greater sensitivity, the later-type stars must be monitored to these correspondingly fainter magnitudes, which can engender several practical problems. We show that with modest modifications, the Kepler mission could extend its effective sensitivity from its current M\textsubscript{V}=6 to 9. This would not capture the whole M dwarf peak but would roughly triple its sensitivity to Earth-like planets in the habitable zone. To take advantage of the huge bump in the sensitivity function at M\textsubscript{V}=12 would require major changes in Kepler. However, the reduced photometric-precision requirements at M\textsubscript{V}=12 makes a search for these transits possible from the ground. Photometric stability requirements are much less severe for M stars than G stars. To detect Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone around G stars, the variability on transit timescales must be less than 2\texttimes 10\textsuperscript{-5}, but for middle M stars the limit is 1.2\texttimes 10\textsuperscript{-3}.},

This map covers the sky north of a declination of -30 degrees, out to a distance of several kiloparsecs. This new map contains three major improvements over our previous work. First, the inclusion of Gaia parallaxes dramatically improves distance estimates to nearby stars. Second, we incorporate a spatial prior that correlates the dust density across nearby sightlines. This produces a smoother map, with more isotropic clouds and smaller distance uncertainties, particularly to clouds within the nearest kiloparsec. Third, we infer the dust density with a distance resolution that is four times finer than in our previous work, to accommodate the improvements in signal-to-noise enabled by the other improvements. As part of this work, we infer the distances, reddenings and types of 799 million stars. We obtain typical reddening uncertainties that are \textasciitilde 30\% smaller than those reported in the Gaia DR2 catalog, reflecting the greater number of photometric passbands that enter into our analysis.

  abstract = {\emph{Context.{$<$}i/{$>$} Mass loss is one of the fundamental properties of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, but for stars with initial masses below \textasciitilde 1 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, the mass loss on the first red giant branch (RGB) actually dominates mass loss on the AGB. Nevertheless, mass loss on the RGB is still often parameterised by a simple Reimers law in stellar evolution models. \emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We study the infrared excess and mass loss of a sample of nearby RGB stars with reliably measured Hipparcos parallaxes and compare the mass loss to that derived for luminous stars in clusters.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} The spectral energy distributions of a well-defined sample of 54 RGB stars are constructed, and fitted with the dust radiative transfer model DUSTY. The central stars are modelled by MARCS model atmospheres. In a first step, the best-fit MARCS model is derived, basically determining the effective temperature. In a second step, models with a finite dust optical depth are fitted and it is determined whether the reduction in \emph{{$\chi<$}i/{$>$}\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$} in such models with one additional free parameter is statistically significant.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} Among the 54 stars, 23 stars are found to have a significant infrared excess, which is interpreted as mass loss. The most luminous star with \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$} = 1860 \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} is found to undergo mass loss, while none of the 5 stars with \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 262 \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} display evidence of mass loss. In the range 265 {$<$} \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$} {$<$} 1500 \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}, 22 stars out of 48 experience mass loss, which supports the notion of episodic mass loss. It is the first time that excess emission is found in stars fainter than \textasciitilde 600 \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$}. The dust optical depths are translated into mass-loss rates \emph{assuming {$<$}i/{$>$}a typical expansion velocity of 10 km s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$} and a dust-to-gas ratio of 0.005. In this case, fits to the stars with an excess result in log \emph{\.M{$<$}i/{$>$} (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} yr\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}) = (1.4 {$\pm$} 0.4)log \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$} + (-13.2 {$\pm$} 1.2) and log \emph{\.M{$<$}i/{$>$} (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} yr\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}) = (0.9 {$\pm$} 0.3)log (\emph{LR{$<$}i/{$>$}/\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}) + (-13.4 {$\pm$} 1.3) assuming a mass of 1.1 \emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} for all objects. We caution that if the expansion velocity and dust-to-gas ratio have different values from those assumed, the constants in the fit will change. If these parameters are also functions of luminosity, then this would affect both the slopes and the offsets. The mass-loss rates are compared to those derived for luminous stars in globular clusters, by fitting both the infrared excess, as in the present paper, and the chromospheric lines. There is excellent agreement between these values and the mass-loss rates derived from the chromospheric activity. There is a systematic difference with the literature mass-loss rates derived from modelling the infrared excess, and this has been traced to technical details on how the DUSTY radiative transfer model is run. If the present results are combined with those from modelling the chromospheric emission lines, we obtain the fits log \emph{\.M{$<$}i/{$>$} (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} yr\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}) = (1.0 {$\pm$} 0.3)log \emph{L{$<$}i/{$>$} + (-12.0 {$\pm$} 0.9) and log \emph{\.M{$<$}i/{$>$} (\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{{$\odot<$}sub/{$>$} yr\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}) = (0.6 {$\pm$} 0.2)log (\emph{LR{$<$}i/{$>$}/\emph{M{$<$}i/{$>$}) + (-11.9 {$\pm$} 0.9), and find that the metallicity dependence is weak at best. The predictions of these mass-loss rate formula are tested against the recent RGB mass loss determination in NGC 6791. Using a scaling factor of \textasciitilde 10 {$\pm$} \textasciitilde 5, both relations can fit this value. That the scaling factor is larger than unity suggests that the expansion velocity and/or dust-to-gas ratio, or even the dust opacities, are different from the values adopted. Angular diameters are presented for the sample. They may serve as calibrators in interferometric observations.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

Our results suggest a dependence of the magnitude of the surface effect on the mixing length parameter which also, but only minimally, affects the determination of stellar parameters.

  abstract = {Despite more than 20 years since the discovery of the first gas giant  planet with an anomalously large radius, the mechanism for planet inflation remains unknown. Here, we report the discovery of K2-132b, an inflated gas giant planet found with the NASA K2 Mission, and a revised mass for another inflated planet, K2-97b. These planets orbit on {$\approx$}9 day orbits around host stars that recently evolved into red giants. We constrain the irradiation history of these planets using models constrained by asteroseismology and Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer spectroscopy and radial velocity measurements. We measure planet radii of 1.31 {$\pm$} 0.11 R J and 1.30 {$\pm$} 0.07 R J, respectively. These radii are typical for planets receiving the current irradiation, but not the former, zero age main-sequence irradiation of these planets. This suggests that the current sizes of these planets are directly correlated to their current irradiation. Our precise constraints of the masses and radii of the stars and planets in these systems allow us to constrain the planetary heating efficiency of both systems as 0.03\{ \% \}-0.02 \% +0.03 \% . These results are consistent with a planet re-inflation scenario, but suggest that the efficiency of planet re-inflation may be lower than previously theorized. Finally, we discuss the agreement within 10\% of the stellar masses and radii, and the planet masses, radii, and orbital periods of both systems, and speculate that this may be due to selection bias in searching for planets around evolved stars.},

Using the isochrones from Victoria-Regina with = +0.37 we find Gyr, whereas the Yonsei-Yale (\emph{Y{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$}) isochrones lead to Gyr, and BaSTI isochrones to Gyr. In a mass-radius diagram, the 7.7 Gyr VRSS and 9.0 Gyr BaSTI isochrones overlap nearly perfectly despite the age-difference. This model dependence, which is significantly larger than the precision determined from mass, radius, and abundance uncertainties, prevents a definitive age-determination of the cluster.\emph{Conclusions. {$<$}i/{$>$}Using detached eclipsing binaries for determination of cluster ages, the dominant error is due to differences among stellar models and no longer to observational errors in cluster reddening and distance. By observing a suitable number of detached eclipsing binaries in several open clusters it should be possible to calibrate the age-scale and provide firm constraints which stellar models must reproduce.}}}}}}}},

This binary has a circular orbit, an orbital period of 1.2 days, and contains two stars of almost identical masses (M1 = 1.72 M, M2 = 1.71 M). However, the cooler secondary star is more evolved (R2 = 1.96 R), while the hotter primary is still on the zero-age-main-sequence (R1 = 1.53 R). Coeval models from single-star evolution cannot explain the observed masses and radii, and binary evolution with mass-transfer needs to be invoked. After subtracting the binary light curve, the Fourier spectrum shows low-order pressure-mode pulsations, and more dominantly, a cluster of low-frequency gravity modes at about 2 day-1. These g-modes are nearly equally spaced in period, and the period spacing pattern has a negative slope. We identify these g-modes as prograde dipole modes and find that they stem from the secondary star. The frequency range of unstable p-modes also agrees with that of the secondary. We derive the internal rotation rate of the convective core and the asymptotic period spacing from the observed g-modes. The resulting values suggest that the core and envelope rotate nearly uniformly, i.e., their rotation rates are both similar to the orbital frequency of this synchronized binary.},

  abstract = {Stars are strongly clustered on both large {\~(}pc) and small {\~(}binary) scales, but there are few analytic or even semi-analytic theories for the correlation function and multiplicity of stars. In this paper, we present such a theory, based on our recently developed semi-analytic framework called MISFIT (Minimalistic Star Formation Including Turbulence), which models gravito-turbulent fragmentation, including the suppression of fragmentation by protostellar radiation feedback. We compare the results including feedback to a control model in which it is omitted. We show that both classes of models robustly reproduce the stellar correlation function at \&gt;0.01 pc scales, which is well approximated by a power law that follows generally from scale-free physics (turbulence plus gravity) on large scales. On smaller scales, protostellar disc fragmentation becomes dominant over common core fragmentation, leading to a steepening of the correlation function. Multiplicity is more sensitive to feedback: we found that a model with the protostellar heating reproduces the observed multiplicity fractions and mass ratio distributions for both Solar and sub-Solar mass stars (in particular, the brown dwarf desert), while a model without feedback fails to do so. The model with feedback also produces an at-formation period distribution consistent with the one inferred from observations. However, it is unable to produce short-range binaries below the length-scale of protostellar discs. We suggest that such close binaries are produced primarily by disc fragmentation and further decrease their separation through orbital decay.},

For these stars, the pulsations are driven by the opacity bump of Fe-group elements at around 200,000 K in the stellar envelope. For \$\textbackslash delta\$ Scuti pulsations in A-type stars, pulsations are driven instead by the \$\textbackslash kappa\$ effect in the second helium ionization region at around 50,000 K. Opacity modifications investigated for B-type stars may also have an effect on the structure of A-type stars and the instability region. Studies of the pulsation instability region for A-type stars show that other factors also influence the pulsations, for example, helium abundance and diffusive settling. Here we explore some of these effects, focusing on modeling of A-type stars. We compare results using the new LANL OPLIB vs. LLNL OPAL opacities for the AGSS09 solar abundance mixture.

The primary and secondary components of KIC 4544587 reside within the {$\delta$} Scuti and {$\gamma$} Dor instability region of the Hertzsprung\textendash Russell diagram, respectively. By applying the binary modelling software PHOEBE to prewhitened Kepler photometric data and radial velocity data obtained using the William Herschel Telescope and 4-m Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak Northern Observatory (KPNO), the fundamental parameters of this important system have been determined, including the stellar masses, 1.98 {$\pm$}0.07 and 1.60 {$\pm$} 0.06 M , and radii, 1.76 {$\pm$} 0.03 and 1.42 {$\pm$} 0.02 R , for the primary and secondary components, respectively. Frequency analysis of the residual data revealed 31 modes, 14 in the gravity mode region and 17 in the pressure mode region. Of the 14 gravity modes, 8 are orbital harmonics: a signature of tidal resonance. While the measured amplitude of these modes may be partially attributed to residual signal from binary model subtraction, we demonstrate through consideration of the folded light curve that these frequencies do in fact correspond to tidally excited pulsations. Furthermore, we present an echelle diagram of the pressure mode frequency region (modulo the orbital frequency) and demonstrate that the tides are also influencing the p modes. A first look at asteroseismology hints that the secondary component is responsible for the p modes, which is contrary to our expectation that the hotter star should pulsate in higher radial overtone, higher frequency p modes.},

The results show that the system contains a slightly evolved F star with an M secondary companion in a highly eccentric orbit (e = 0.886). We use the results of the binary star model in a companion paper (Fuller) where we show that the prominent pulsation can be explained by a tidally excited oscillation mode held near resonance by a resonance locking mechanism.},

  abstract = {We present a timing analysis of the eclipsing post-common envelope binary (PCEB) DE CVn. Based on new CCD photometric observations and the published data, we found that the orbital period in DE CVn has a cyclic period oscillation with an amplitude of \$28.08\$ s and a period of \$11.22\$ years plus a rapid period decrease at a rate of \$\textbackslash dot\{P\}=-3.35\textbackslash times10\^\{-11\}ss\^\{-1\}\$. According to the evolutionary theory, secular period decreases in PCEBs arise from angular momentum losses (AMLs) driven by gravitational radiation (GR) and magnetic braking (MB). However, the observed orbital decay is too fast to be produced by AMLs via GR and MB, indicating that there could be other AML mechanism. We suggest that a circumbinary disk around DE CVn may be responsible for the additional AML. The disk mass was derived as a few\$\textbackslash times\$\$10\^\{-4\}\$-\$10\^\{-3\}\$\$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ , which is in agreement with that inferred from previous studies in the order of magnitude. The cyclic change is most likely result of the gravitational perturbation by a circumbinary object due to the Applegate's mechanism fails to explain such a large period oscillation. The mass of the potential third body is calculated as \$M\_\{3\}\textbackslash sin\{i'\}=0.011(\textbackslash pm0.003)M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. Supposing the circumbinary companion and the eclipsing binary is coplanar, its mass would correspond to a giant planet. This hypothetical giant planet is moving in a circular orbit of radius \$\textbackslash sim5.75(\textbackslash pm2.02)\$ AU around its host star.},

  abstract = {One of the tasks of the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Operations Center (KASOC) is to provide asteroseismic analyses on Kepler Objects of Interest. However, asteroseismic analysis of planetary host stars presents some unique complications with respect to data pre-processing, compared to pure asteroseismic targets. If not accounted for, the presence of planetary transits in the photometric time series often greatly complicates or even hinders these asteroseismic analyses. This drives the need for specialized methods of pre-processing data to make them suitable for asteroseismic analysis. In this paper, we present the KASOC filter, which is used to automatically prepare data from the Kepler/K2 mission for asteroseismic analyses of solarlike planet host stars. The methods are very effective at removing unwanted signals of both instrumental and planetary origins and produce significantly cleaner photometric time series than the original data. The methods are automated and can therefore easily be applied to a large number of stars. The application of the filter is not restricted to planetary hosts, but can be applied to any solar-like or red giant stars observed by Kepler/K2.},

  abstract = {We present an extensive peakbagging effort on Kepler data of {$\sim$}50 red  giant stars in the open star cluster NGC 6819. By employing sophisticated pre-processing of the time series and Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques we extracted individual frequencies, heights and line widths for hundreds of oscillation modes. We show that the 'average' asteroseismic parameter {$\delta\nu$}02, derived from these, can be used to distinguish the stellar evolutionary state between the red giant branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars. Masses and radii are estimated using asteroseismic scaling relations, both empirically corrected to obtain self-consistency and agreement with independent measures of distance, and using updated theoretical corrections. Remarkable agreement is found, allowing the evolutionary state of the giants to be determined exclusively from the empirical correction to the scaling relations. We find a mean mass of the RGB stars and RC stars in NGC 6819 to be 1.61 {$\pm$} 0.02 and 1.64 {$\pm$} 0.02 M{$\odot$}, respectively. The difference {$\Delta$}M = -0.03 {$\pm$} 0.01 M{$\odot$} is almost insensitive to systematics, suggesting very little RGB mass loss, if any. Stars that are outliers relative to the ensemble reveal overmassive members that likely evolved via mass transfer in a blue straggler phase. We suggest that KIC 4937011, a low-mass Li-rich giant, is a cluster member in the RC phase that experienced very high mass loss during its evolution. Such over- and undermassive stars need to be considered when studying field giants, since the true age of such stars cannot be known and there is currently no way to distinguish them from normal stars.},

In this paper, we present planet occurrence rates for mid-type M dwarfs using spectroscopy, parallaxes, and photometry to determine stellar characteristics. Our spectroscopic observations have allowed us to constrain spectral type, temperatures, and, in some cases, metallicities for 337 out of 561 probable mid-type M dwarfs in the primary Kepler field. We use a random forest classifier to assign a spectral type to the remaining 224 stars. Combining our data with Gaia parallaxes, we compute precise {\~(}3\%) stellar radii and masses, which we use to update planet parameters and occurrence rates for Kepler mid-type M dwarfs. Within the Kepler field, there are seven M3 V to M5 V stars that host 13 confirmed planets between 0.5 and 2.5 Earth radii and at orbital periods between 0.5 and 10 days. For this population, we compute a planet occurrence rate of \{1.19\}\textsubscript{-0.49}\textsuperscript{+0.70} planets per star.

  abstract = {High-precision Kepler photometry is used to explore the details of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) light curves. Since AGB variability has a typical timescale on the order of a year, we discuss at length the removal of long-term trends and quarterly changes in Kepler data. Photometry for a small sample of nine semi-regular (SR) AGB stars is examined using a 30 minute cadence over a period of 45 months. While undergoing long-period variations of many magnitudes, the light curves are shown to be smooth at the millimagnitude level over much shorter time intervals. No flares or other rapid events were detected on a sub-day timescale. The shortest AGB period detected is on the order of 100 days. All the SR variables in our sample are shown to have multiple modes. This is always the first overtone, typically combined with the fundamental. A second common characteristic of SR variables is shown to be the simultaneous excitation of multiple closely separated periods for the same overtone mode. Approximately half the sample had a much longer variation in the light curve, likely a long secondary period (LSP). The light curves were all well represented by a combination of sinusoids. However, the properties of the sinusoids are time variable, with irregular variations present at low levels. No non-radial pulsations were detected. It is argued that the LSP variation seen in many SR variables is intrinsic to the star and linked to multiple mode pulsation.},

Binary population-synthesis models explain naturally the actual sdB binary fractions of field and globular cluster stars as well as of He-sdOs if white-dwarf mergers are considered. Hot helium flashes explain the chemical composition of He-sdOs. Asteroseismology of a dozen pulsating sdB stars allowed determination of their masses and detection of a planet to V391 Peg.

These timeseries allow us to derive asteroseismic global oscillation parameters of red-giant stars in the three open clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6819 and NGC 6811. From these parameters and effective temperatures, we derive masses, radii and luminosities for the clusters as well as field red giants. Aims: We study the influence of evolution and metallicity on the observed red-giant populations. Methods: The global oscillation parameters are derived using different published methods and the effective temperatures are derived from 2MASS colours. The observational results are compared with BaSTI evolution models. Results: We find that the mass has significant influence on the asteroseismic quantities {$\Delta\nu$} vs. {$\nu$}max relation, while the influence of metallicity is negligible, under the assumption that the metallicity does not affect the excitation/damping of the oscillations. The positions of the stars in the H-R diagram depend on both mass and metallicity. Furthermore, the stellar masses derived for the field stars are bracketed by those of the cluster stars.  Conclusions: Both the mass and metallicity contribute to the observed difference in locations in the H-R diagram of the old metal-rich cluster NGC 6791 and the middle-aged solar-metallicity cluster NGC 6819. For the young cluster NGC 6811, the explanation of the position of the stars in the H-R diagram challenges the assumption of solar metallicity, and this open cluster might have significantly lower metallicity [Fe/H] in the range - 0.3 to - 0.7 dex. Also, nearly all the observed field stars seem to be older than NGC 6811 and younger than NGC 6791.},

These stellar parameters combined with chemical composition and the position, distance and velocity of the stars play an important role in studying the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. In this chapter we discuss some key physical phenomena that are at play in (red-giant) stars as well as some important phases in red-giant evolution. Subsequently, oscillation characteristics that are of importance for the determination of stellar parameters (as indicated above) of red-giant stars are introduced followed by a description of the main components of the Milky Way. Finally, the role red giants can play in creating a detailed observational picture of the Milky Way and deciphering the formation and evolution of the Milky Way is discussed. {$<$}P /{$>$}},

  abstract = {Context: Observations during the first long run (\textasciitilde 150 days) in the  exo-planet field of CoRoT increase the number of G-K giant stars for which solar-like oscillations are observed by a factor of 100. This opens the possibility to study the characteristics of their oscillations in a statistical sense. Aims: We aim to understand the statistical distribution of the frequencies of maximum oscillation power ({$\nu\_$}max) in red giants and to search for a possible correlation between {$\nu\_$}max and the large separation ({$\Delta$} {$\nu$}). Methods: Red giants with detectable solar-like oscillations are identified using both semi-automatic and manual procedures. For these stars, we determine {$\nu\_$}max as the centre of a Gaussian fit to the oscillation power excess. For the determination of {$\Delta$} {$\nu$}, we use the autocorrelation of the Fourier spectra, the comb response function and the power spectrum of the power spectrum. Results: The resulting {$\nu\_$}max distribution shows a pronounced peak between 20-40 {$\mu$}Hz. For about half of the stars we obtain {$\Delta$} {$\nu$} with at least two methods. The correlation between {$\nu\_$}max and {$\Delta$} {$\nu$} follows the same scaling relation as inferred for solar-like stars. Conclusions: The shape of the {$\nu\_$}max distribution can partly be explained by granulation at low frequencies and by white noise at high frequencies, but the population density of the observed stars turns out to be also an important factor. From the fact that the correlation between {$\Delta$} {$\nu$} and {$\nu\_$}max for red giants follows the same scaling relation as obtained for sun-like stars, we conclude that the sound travel time over the pressure scale height of the atmosphere scales with the sound travel time through the whole star irrespective of evolution. The fraction of stars for which we determine {$\Delta$} {$\nu$} does not correlate with {$\nu\_$}max in the investigated frequency range, which confirms theoretical predictions.

Long near-uninterrupted high-precision photometric timeseries observations from dedicated space missions such as CoRoT and Kepler have provided seismic inferences of the global and internal properties of a large number of evolved stars, including red giants. These inferences are confronted with predictions from theoretical models to improve our understanding of stellar structure and evolution. Our knowledge and understanding of red giants have indeed increased tremendously using these seismic inferences, and we anticipate that more information is still hidden in the data. Unraveling this will further improve our understanding of stellar evolution. This will also have significant impact on our knowledge of the Milky Way Galaxy as well as on exo-planet host stars.

We implement an alternative mathematical description compared to what is used in the literature to analyse observational data and to extract the underlying physical parameters that determine the frequencies of mixed modes. This description takes the radial order of the modes explicitly into account, which reduces its sensitivity to aliases. Additionally, and for the first time, this method allows us to constrain the gravity mode offset g for red-giant stars. Results. We find that this alternative mathematical description allows us to determine the period spacing {$\increment\Pi$} and the coupling term q for the dipole modes within a few percent of values found in the literature. Additionally, we find that g varies on a star-by-star basis and should not be kept fixed in the analysis. Furthermore, we find that the coupling factor is logarithmically related to the physical width of the evanescent region normalised by the radius at which the evanescent zone is located. Finally, the local density contrast at the edge of the core of red-giant branch models shows a tentative correlation with the offset g. Conclusions. We are continuing to exploit the full potential of the mixed modes to investigate the internal structures of red-giant stars; in this case we focus on the evanescent zone. It remains, however, important to perform comparisons between observations and models with great care as the methods employed are sensitive to the range of input frequencies.},

  abstract = {Methods. We use published methods to derive {$\nu$}max and {$\Delta\nu$} for timeseries ranging from 50 to 600 days and compare these results as a function of method, timespan and {$\Delta\nu$} . Results. We find that in general a minimum of the order of 400 day long timeseries are necessary to obtain reliable results for the global oscillation parameters in more than 95\% of the stars, but this does depend on {$\Delta\nu$} . In a statistical sense the quoted uncertainties seem to provide a reasonable indication of the precision of the obtained results in short (50-day) runs, they do however seem to be overestimated for results of longer runs. Furthermore, the different definitions of the global parameters used in the different methods have non-negligible effects on the obtained values. Additionally, we show that there is a correlation between {$\nu$}max and the flux variance. Conclusions. We conclude that longer timeseries improve the likelihood to detect oscillations with automated codes (from {$\sim$}60\% in 50 day runs to {$>$}95\% in 400 day runs with a slight method dependence) and the precision of the obtained global oscillation parameters. The trends suggest that the improvement will continue for even longer timeseries than the 600 days considered here, with a reduction in the median absolute deviation of more than a factor of 10 for an increase in timespan from 50 to 2000 days (the currently foreseen length of the mission). This work shows that global parameters determined with high precision \textendash{} thus from long datasets \textendash using different definitions can be used to identify the evolutionary state of the stars.},

The corresponding rates of escape of stars and of kinetic energy are computed here for an arbitrary distribution of stellar masses in the cluster. Under two assumptions: spherical symmetry of the cluster and isotropy of the velocity distribution at every point, general expressions are derived (Eqs. 15 and 23). These expressions are in the case of Plummer's model (Eqs. 31, 36, 41, 43). Reasonable agreement is found with the resnlts derived from numerical experiments by Aarseth and Wielen. The rate of escape of stars is quite sensitive to the mass distribution: it is typically multiplied by a factor 30 or more when equal masses are replaced by unequal masses.},

  abstract = {We present a global analysis of KOI-977, one of the planet host candidates detected by Kepler. The Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) reports that KOI-977 is a red giant, for which few close-in planets have been discovered. Our global analysis involves spectroscopic and asteroseismic determinations of stellar parameters (e.g., mass and radius) and radial velocity (RV) measurements. Our analyses reveal that KOI-977 is indeed a red giant, possibly in the red clump, but its estimated radius ( 20 R = 0.093 AU) is much larger than KOI-977.01's orbital distance ({$\sim$}0.027 AU) estimated from its period (Porb {$\sim$} 1.35 days) and host star's mass. RV measurements show a small variation, which also contradicts the amplitude of ellipsoidal variations seen in the light curve folded with KOI-977.01's period. Therefore, we conclude that KOI-977.01 is a false positive, meaning that the red giant, for which we measured the radius and RVs, is different from the object that produces the transit-like signal (i.e., an eclipsing binary). On the basis of this assumption, we also perform a light curve analysis including the modeling of transits/eclipses and phase-curve variations, adopting various values for the dilution factor D, which is defined as the flux ratio between the red giant and eclipsing binary. Fitting the whole folded light curve as well as individual transits in the short cadence data simultaneously, we find that the estimated mass and radius ratios of the eclipsing binary are consistent with those of a solar-type star and a late-type star (e.g., an M dwarf) for D 20.},

The system is comprised of four transiting planet candidates with orbital periods of 22.3 (KOI-94.01), 10.4 (KOI-94.02), 54.3 (KOI-94.03), and 3.7 (KOI-94.04) days from the Kepler photometry. We performed the radial velocity (RV) measurement of the system with the Subaru 8.2 m telescope on UT 2012 August 10, covering a complete transit of KOI-94.01 for {$\sim$}6.7 hr. The resulting RV variation due to the RM effect spectroscopically confirms that KOI-94.01 is indeed the transiting planet and implies that its orbital axis is well aligned with the stellar spin axis; the projected spin\textendash orbit angle {$\lambda$} is estimated as -6+-1131 deg. This is the first measurement of the RM effect for a multiple transiting system. Remarkably, the archived Kepler light curve around BJD = 2455211.5 (date in UT 2010 January 14/15) indicates a ``double-transit'' event of KOI-94.01 and KOI94.03, in which the two planets transit the stellar disk simultaneously. Moreover, the two planets partially overlap with each other, and exhibit a ``planet\textendash planet eclipse'' around the transit center. This provides a rare opportunity to put tight constraints on the configuration of the two transiting planets by joint analysis with our Subaru RM measurement. Indeed, we find that the projected mutual inclination of KOI-94.01 and KOI-94.03 is estimated to be {$\delta$} = -1{$\smwhtcircle$}.15 {$\pm$} 0{$\smwhtcircle$}.55. Implications for the migration model of multiple planet systems are also discussed.},

Results from all independent methods are consistent with HD 185351 having a mass in excess of 1.5 M . However, the study also showed that not all observational constraints could be reconciled in stellar evolutionary models, leading to mass estimates ranging from {$\sim$}1.6 to 1.9 M and casting doubts on the accuracy of stellar properties determined from asteroseismology. Here, we solve this discrepancy and construct a theoretical model in agreement with all observational constraints on the physical parameters of HD 185351. The effects of varying input physics are examined as well as the additional constraint of the observed g-mode period spacing is considered. This quantity is found to be sensitive to the inclusion of additional mixing from the convective core during the main sequence, and can be used to calibrate the overshooting efficiency using low-luminosity red giant stars. A theoretical model with metallicity [Fe/H] = 0.16 dex, mixing-length parameter {$\alpha$}MLT = 2.00, and convective overshooting efficiency parameter f = 0.030 is found to be in complete agreement with all observational constraints for a stellar mass of M 1.60 M .},

Within the first century following Fabricius, four Mira-type variables were discovered, and in all cases it has been found that the stars were suspected of being novae long before their "official" discovery in the Western World. Three of the four had been recorded as novae in early Chinese or Korean records. By 1896, 251 Mira-type variabes had been discovered, most of them after the beginning of photographic experimentation. Now in the year of the fourth centennial, over 6000 Miras are known. Because of their ease of discovery relative to stars of small amplitude, no new Mira stars reaching naked-eye visibility have been discovered since 1899. The history of the discovery of Mira-type variables illustrates that (1) some new discoveries are re-discoveries of objects previously assumed to be novae; and (2) apparently logical deductions that early observations of a guest star correspond to a later discovered Mire-type may nevertheless be wrong.},

The precision afforded to the K2 data allow us to identify at least 11 pulsation modes in this star, compared to the three previously reported. Reoccurring separations between these modes lead us to suggest a large frequency separation, {$\Delta\nu$}, of 78.9 {$\mu$} Hz, twice that reported in the literature. Other frequency separations we detect may represent the small frequency separation, {$\delta\nu$}, but this is inconclusive at this stage due to magnetic perturbation of the frequencies. Due to the highly non-linear pulsation in 33 Lib, we identify harmonics to four times the principal frequency. Furthermore, we note a unique occurrence of non-linear interactions of the 11 identified modes. The frequency separations of the modes around the principal frequency are replicated around the first harmonic, with some interaction with the second harmonic also. Such a phenomenon has not been seen in roAp stars before. With revised stellar parameters, linear non-adiabatic modelling of 33 Lib shows that the pulsations are not greater than the acoustic cutoff frequency, and that the {$\kappa$}-mechanism can excite the observed modes. Our observations are consistent with 33 Lib having a rotation period much larger than 88 d as presented in the literature.},

Spectral analysis confirms the Ap nature of the target, with characteristic lines of Eu II, Nd III and Pr III present. The spectra are not greatly affected by broadening, which is consistent with the long rotational period found from photometry. From our spectral observations we derive a lower limit on the mean magnetic field modulus of B = 3.05 {$\pm$} 0.23 kG. Long cadence Kepler observations show a frequency quintuplet split by the rotational period of the star, typical for an oblique pulsator. We suggest the star is a quadrupole pulsator with a geometry such that i {$\sim$} 66{$\smwhtcircle$} and {$\beta$} {$\sim$} 33{$\smwhtcircle$}. We detect frequency variations of the pulsation in both the WASP and Kepler data sets on many time-scales. Linear, non-adiabatic stability modelling allows us to constrain a region on the Hertzsprung\textendash Russell diagram where the pulsations are unstable, an area consistent with observations.},

To make our method useful for current and future space missions such as K2, TESS, and PLATO, we train classifiers that are able to classify the evolutionary states of lower frequency resolution spectra expected from these missions. Additionally, we provide new classifications for 8633 Kepler red giants, out of which 426 have previously not been classified using asteroseismology. This brings the total to 14983 Kepler red giants classified with our new neural network. We also verify that our classifiers are remarkably robust to suboptimal data, including low signal-to-noise and incorrect training truth labels.},

  abstract = {Time-resolved photometry of tens of thousands of red giant stars from space missions like Kepler and K2 has created the need for automated asteroseismic analysis methods. The first and most fundamental step in such analysis is to identify which stars show oscillations. It is critical that this step be performed with no, or little, detection bias, particularly when performing subsequent ensemble analyses that aim to compare the properties of observed stellar populations with those from galactic models. However, an efficient, automated solution to this initial detection step still has not been found, meaning that expert visual inspection of data from each star is required to obtain the highest level of detections. Hence, to mimic how an expert eye analyzes the data, we use supervised deep learning to not only detect oscillations in red giants, but also to predict the location of the frequency at maximum power, {$\nu$}max, by observing features in 2D images of power spectra. By training on Kepler data, we benchmark our deep-learning classifier against K2 data that are given detections by the expert eye, achieving a detection accuracy of 98\% on K2 Campaign 6 stars and a detection accuracy of 99\% on K2 Campaign 3 stars. We further find that the estimated uncertainty of our deep-learning-based {$\nu$}max predictions is about 5\%. This is comparable to human-level performance using visual inspection. When examining outliers, we find that the deep-learning results are more likely to provide robust {$\nu$}max estimates than the classical model-fitting method.},

Despite this, no wide search for red giants showing solar-like oscillations have been made across all stars observed in Kepler's long-cadence mode. In this work, we perform this task using custom apertures on the Kepler pixel files and detect oscillations in 21 914 stars, representing the largest sample of solar-like oscillating stars to date. We measure their frequency at maximum power, {$\nu$}\textsubscript{max}, down to {$\nu$} \_\{max\} {$\simeq$} 4 {$\mu$}Hz and obtain log (g) estimates with a typical uncertainty below 0.05 dex, which is superior to typical measurements from spectroscopy. Additionally, the {$\nu$}\textsubscript{max} distribution of our detections show good agreement with results from a simulated model of the Milky Way, with a ratio of observed to predicted stars of 0.992 for stars with 10 \&lt; {$\nu$} \_\{max\}\&lt; 270 {$\mu$}Hz. Among our red giant detections, we find 909 to be dwarf/subgiant stars whose flux signal is polluted by a neighbouring giant as a result of using larger photometric apertures than those used by the NASA Kepler science processing pipeline. We further find that only 293 of the polluting giants are known Kepler targets. The remainder comprises over 600 newly identified oscillating red giants, with many expected to belong to the Galactic halo, serendipitously falling within the Kepler pixel files of targeted stars.},

We use 2MASS photometric data for a sample of 31 clusters in the outer Galaxy for which near-IR polarimetric data were obtained to determine the cluster distances, ages, and reddenings via fitting theoretical isochrones to cluster color\textendash magnitude diagrams. The fitting approach uses an objective {$\chi$} 2 minimization technique to derive the cluster properties and their uncertainties. We found the ages, distances, and reddenings for 24 of the clusters, and the distances and reddenings for 6 additional clusters that were either sparse or faint in the near-IR. The derived ranges of log(age), distance, and E ( B - V ) were 7.25\textendash 9.63, {$\sim$}670\textendash 6160 pc, and 0.02\textendash 1.46 mag, respectively. The distance uncertainties ranged from {$\sim$}8\% to 20\%. The derived parameters were compared to previous studies, and most cluster parameters agree within our uncertainties. To test the accuracy of the fitting technique, synthetic clusters with 50, 100, or 200 cluster members and a wide range of ages were fit. These tests recovered the input parameters within their uncertainties for more than 90\% of the individual synthetic cluster parameters. These results indicate that the fitting technique likely provides reliable estimates of cluster properties. The distances derived will be used in an upcoming study of the Galactic magnetic field in the outer Galaxy.},

The amplitudes are determined by the balance between acoustical energy generation by turbulent convection (the Lighthill mechanism) and linear damping. Convection is treated with a time-dependent, nonlocal, mixing-length model, which includes both convective heat flux and turbulent pressure in both the equilibrium model and the pulsations. Velocity and luminosity amplitudes are computed for stars with masses between 0.9 M\_\textbackslash sun and 2.0 M\_\textbackslash sun in the vicinity of the main sequence, for various metallicities and convection parameters. As in previous studies, the amplitudes are found to increase with stellar mass, and therefore with luminosity. Amongst those stars that are pulsationally stable, the largest amplitudes are predicted for a 1.6 M\_\textbackslash sun model of spectral type F2; the values are approximately 15 times larger than those measured in the Sun.},

Earlier measurements of the masses and radii of the detached system were not accurate enough for photometric and spectroscopic data to demonstrate that there are significant differences between current stellar models. Here we improved on the result and add follow-up measurements of the system. Data from the Kepler archive makes it clear that the system has an inclination that is close to 90\textdegree. The combination of radial velocity and Kepler light curve of the system were analysed simultaneously, which allows us to determine a reliable mass for the primary and secondary star and radii for both stars, and to constrain the cluster age. The characteristics of the primary star at the cluster turnoff indicate an age of 8.5 {$\pm$} 0.12 Gyr, consistent with earlier analysis of the color-magnitude diagram. The brighter star in the binary also produces a precision estimate of the distance modulus, independent of reddening estimates: (m-M)V (mag)=13.899 {$\pm$} 0.117. The secondary star is not expected to have evolved significantly, but its radius is more than 10\% larger than predicted by models. The hallmark is useful for testing the idea that radius inflation can occur in short period binaries for stars with significant convective envelopes due to the inhibition of energy transport by magnetic fields.},

The sample includes stars ranging in evolution from the lower part of the red giant branch to the helium main sequence. We investigate the relation between the large frequency separation ({$\Delta\nu$}) and the frequency of maximum power ({$\nu$}max) and show that it is different for red giants than for main-sequence stars, which is consistent with evolutionary models and scaling relations. The distributions of {$\nu$}max and {$\Delta\nu$} are in qualitative agreement with a simple stellar population model of the Kepler field, including the first evidence for a secondary clump population characterized by M 2 M and {$\nu$}max 40\textendash 110 {$\mu$}Hz. We measured the small frequency separations {$\delta\nu$}02 and {$\delta\nu$}01 in over 400 stars and {$\delta\nu$}03 in over 40. We present C-D diagrams for l = 1, 2, and 3 and show that the frequency separation ratios {$\delta\nu$}02/{$\Delta\nu$} and {$\delta\nu$}01/{$\Delta\nu$} have opposite trends as a function of {$\Delta\nu$}. The data show a narrowing of the l = 1 ridge toward lower {$\nu$}max, in agreement with models predicting more efficient mode trapping in stars with higher luminosity. We investigate the offset in the asymptotic relation and find a clear correlation with {$\Delta\nu$}, demonstrating that it is related to fundamental stellar parameters. Finally, we present the first amplitude\textendash{$\nu$}max relation for Kepler red giants. We observe a lack of low-amplitude stars for {$\nu$}max 110 {$\mu$}Hz and find that, for a given {$\nu$}max between 40 and 110 {$\mu$}Hz, stars with lower {$\Delta\nu$} (and consequently higher mass) tend to show lower amplitudes than stars with higher {$\Delta\nu$}.},

  abstract = {The Kepler/K2 Mission has revolutionized asteroseismology by detecting oscillations in thousands of stars from the main-sequence to the red giant branch. By providing accurate radii, masses and ages, these stars have become benchmarks for addressing problems in stellar astrophysics, exoplanet science and galactic astronomy, such as age-rotation relationships for solar-type stars, the composition of super-Earth sized planets, and the study of galactic stellar populations. However, our sample of dwarfs and subgiants with asteroseismic data is small because detection requires scarce short cadence imaging, and only a fraction of the short cadence targets in Kepler have been characterized. By contrast, there is a rich data set of red giant asteroseismology from Kepler and K2, but the dwell time for K2 and TESS is too short to detect asteroseismic signals directly in luminous and scientifically interesting targets. In this proposal we address both problems, capitalizing on the vastly improved classification of Kepler/K2 targets provided by Gaia parallaxes. We will first dramatically increase the size of the high-quality dwarf and subgiant asteroseismic sample from Kepler. We propose a homogeneous analysis of the recently re-processed Q1-17 Kepler short-cadence data, which corrected data calibration errors that affected prior seismic analysis efforts. For dwarfs and subgiants we will combine well tested frequency-autocorrelation methods with ground-based spectroscopy and adaptive optics imaging to compile a legacy catalog of asteroseismic observables, fundamental parameters, and possible companion stars. Furthermore we will calibrate stellar granulation diagnostics of surface gravity for high luminosity giants using data from the original Kepler mission, star clusters and gravities from ground-based spectroscopic surveys. By applying this novel technique to 12500 high-luminosity giants we will significantly increase the reach of galactic populations studied by K2. Our novel method will also be a pathfinder for analogous applications to thousands of highluminosity giants observed with TESS. Combined, these datasets will allow us to 1) investigate variations in age-rotation relationships (gyrochronology) for solar-type stars, 2) identify new asteroseismic exoplanet host stars to validate exoplanet population trends such as the "hot super-Earth desert" and the gap between super-Earth and sub-Neptune sized planets, 3) test the relation between stellar multiplicity and oscillation amplitudes and 4) discover distant, high-luminosity halo giants observed by K2, potentially leading to an ensemble age measurement of the galactic halo. Our program will provide legacy data products for asteroseismic Kepler/K2 stars, including power spectra, asteroseismic observables, and fundamental parameters. These products will be of enormous value for a variety of topics in stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science, including gyrochronology, tests of stellar interior models, and calibrations of indirect methods such as spectroscopy. Benchmark stars with well determined fundamental properties are also essential for the accurate characterization of exoplanets with future NASA missions such as TESS, JWST and WFIRST.},

  abstract = {We present results of a long-baseline interferometry campaign using the PAVO beam combiner at the CHARA Array to measure the angular sizes of five main-sequence stars, one subgiant and four red giant stars for which solarlike oscillations have been detected by either Kepler or CoRoT. By combining interferometric angular diameters, Hipparcos parallaxes, asteroseismic densities, bolometric fluxes, and high-resolution spectroscopy, we derive a full set of near-model-independent fundamental properties for the sample. We first use these properties to test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequency of maximum power ({$\nu$}max) and the large frequency separation ({$\Delta\nu$}). We find excellent agreement within the observational uncertainties, and empirically show that simple estimates of asteroseismic radii for main-sequence stars are accurate to 4\%. We furthermore find good agreement of our measured effective temperatures with spectroscopic and photometric estimates with mean deviations for stars between Teff = 4600\textendash 6200 K of -22 {$\pm$} 32 K (with a scatter of 97 K) and -58 {$\pm$} 31 K (with a scatter of 93 K), respectively. Finally, we present a first comparison with evolutionary models, and find differences between observed and theoretical properties for the metal-rich main-sequence star HD 173701. We conclude that the constraints presented in this study will have strong potential for testing stellar model physics, in particular when combined with detailed modeling of individual oscillation frequencies.},

  abstract = {We have used asteroseismology to determine fundamental properties for 66 Kepler planet-candidate host stars, with typical uncertainties of 3\% and 7\% in radius and mass, respectively. The results include new asteroseismic solutions for four host stars with confirmed planets (Kepler-4, Kepler-14, Kepler-23 and Kepler-25) and increase the total number of Kepler host stars with asteroseismic solutions to 77. A comparison with stellar properties in the planet-candidate catalog by Batalha et al. shows that radii for subgiants and giants obtained from spectroscopic follow-up are systematically too low by up to a factor of 1.5, while the properties for unevolved stars are in good agreement. We furthermore apply asteroseismology to confirm that a large majority of cool main-sequence hosts are indeed dwarfs and not misclassified giants. Using the revised stellar properties, we recalculate the radii for 107 planet candidates in our sample, and comment on candidates for which the radii change from a previously giant-planet/brown-dwarf/stellar regime to a sub-Jupiter size or vice versa. A comparison of stellar densities from asteroseismology with densities derived from transit models in Batalha et al. assuming circular orbits shows significant disagreement for more than half of the sample due to systematics in the modeled impact parameters or due to planet candidates that may be in eccentric orbits. Finally, we investigate tentative correlations between host-star masses and planet-candidate radii, orbital periods, and multiplicity, but caution that these results may be influenced by the small sample size and detection biases.},

We use broadband photometry and asteroseismology to characterize 11,532 Kepler targets which were previously unclassified in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We report the detection of oscillations in 2762 of these targets, classifying them as giant stars and increasing the number of known oscillating giant stars observed by Kepler by {$\sim$}20\% to a total of {$\sim$}15,500 stars. Typical uncertainties in derived radii and masses are {$\sim$}40\% and {$\sim$}20\%, respectively, for stars with photometric constraints only, and 5\%\textendash 15\% and {$\sim$}10\% for stars based on spectroscopy and/or asteroseismology, although these uncertainties vary strongly with spectral type and luminosity class. A comparison with the Q1\textendash Q12 catalog shows a systematic decrease in radii of M dwarfs, while radii for K dwarfs decrease or increase depending on the Q1\textendash Q12 provenance (KIC or Yonsei\textendash Yale isochrones).

  abstract = {We have analyzed solar-like oscillations in {$\sim$}1700 stars observed by the Kepler Mission, spanning from the main sequence to the red clump. Using evolutionary models, we test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequency of maximum power ({$\nu$}max), the large frequency separation ({$\Delta\nu$}), and oscillation amplitudes. We show that the difference of the {$\Delta\nu$}\textendash{$\nu$}max relation for unevolved and evolved stars can be explained by different distributions in effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with what is expected from scaling relations. For oscillation amplitudes, we show that neither (L/M)s scaling nor the revised scaling relation by Kjeldsen \& Bedding is accurate for red-giant stars, and demonstrate that a revised scaling relation with a separate luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculate amplitudes from the main sequence to red giants to a precision of {$\sim$}25\%. The residuals show an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that an additional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the observed amplitudes. We investigate correlations between amplitudes and stellar activity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude suppression is most pronounced for subgiant stars. Finally, we test the location of the cool edge of the instability strip in the Hertzsprung\textendash Russell diagram using solar-like oscillations and find the detections in the hottest stars compatible with a domain of hybrid stochastically excited and opacity driven pulsation.},

Based on spectroscopic analysis of 19 of these stars considered to be red horizontal branch (RHB) members of NGC 6791, we conclude that there is no evidence for significant variations in the CH band or the Ca and Fe line strengths among these stars, although there are strong indications of intrinsic differences among the CN band strengths. There is also no evidence for correlations between the CN band, CH band, or Fe line strengths of these stars, although there may be a weak correlation between CN band and Ca line strengths. The nature of the CN-band inhomogeneity is in marked contrast to the bimodal CN distributions discovered among the RHB stars of the two globular clusters 47 Tue and M71 by Norris \& Freeman [ApJ, 254, 143 (1982)] and Smith \& Penny [AJ, 97, 1397 (1989)]. These results imply that either the environment within which globular clusters formed resulted in initial C and N abundance inhomogeneities that were lacking in NGC 6791, or that the evolutional processes which alter stellar surface abundances prior to or during the core helium-burning phase of evolution, differ in some respect between the disk globular clusters and NGC 6791. \textcopyright{} 1995 American Astronomical Society.},

We have identified NSV 1907 as an ultraviolet (UV) bright source using measurements from the GALEX space telescope and detected obvious out-of-eclipse variability in archival photometric data from the Catalina Sky Survey, which instigated a closer examination of the object. A spectrum and extensive multicolour photometric observations were acquired, from which we deduce that NSV 1907 is a deeply eclipsing, nova-like cataclysmic variable. Apart from the orbital variations (deep eclipses with a period of P {$\approx$} 6.63 hours), changes in mean brightness and irregular short-term variability (flickering) were observed. The presence of a secondary minimum at phase {$\varphi$} {$\approx$} 0.5 was established, which indicates a significant contribution of the companion star to the optical flux of the system. We find possible evidence for sinusoidal variations with a period of P {$\approx$} 4.2 d, which we interpret as the nodal precession period of the accretion disc. No outbursts or VY Scl-like drops in brightness were detected either by the CSS or during our photometric monitoring. Because of its spectral characteristics and the observed variability pattern, we propose NSV 1907 as a new moderately bright long-period SW Sextantis star. Further photometric and spectroscopic observations are encouraged.},

The slopes of these blue edges are very similar to the slopes of the blue edges of instability strips defined by observed Cepheids in external galaxies. By insisting that the theoretical and observed blue edges coincide for any chosen galaxy, one may estimate the distance to that galaxy. The result is very similar to a distance estimated with the help of an empirical period-magnitude relationship normalized by main-sequence fitting. In addition, masses of Cepheids obtained using the periods, surface temperatures, and luminosities (consistent with the derived distance modulus) in a relationship between these quantities derived by pulsation theory defines a semiempirical mass-luminosity relationship which is consistent with the one defined by the theoretical evolution calculations which have been used to construct the theoretical blue edges. Even so, given existing uncertainties in the theoretical evolutionary models, there is no guarantee that the distance moduli and the mass-luminosity relationships derived in this way are correct. However, most remarkably, a forced change in the adopted distance to a group of extragalactic Cepheids does not destroy the coincidence between theoretical blue edges and blue edges defined by the observed Cepheids. When, with the help of pulsation theory, the revised mass-luminosity relationship defined by the observed Cepheids (at the new distance) is inserted into the equation for the theoretical blue edge, this edge moves in such a way as to remain in contact with the blue edge defined by the Cepheids at the new distance. This means that results of calculations using pulsation theory are consistent with the observations, whatever the distance modulus.},

To explore if we can quantify an activity-age relation in the form of a flaring-age relation, we measured trends in the flaring rates and energies for stars with different masses and ages. We investigated the time-domain photometry provided by Kepler's follow-up mission K2 and searched for flares in three solar metallicity open clusters with well-known ages, M45 (0.125 Gyr), M44 (0.63 Gyr), and M67 (4.3 Gyr). We updated and employed the automated flare finding and analysis pipeline Appaloosa, originally designed for Kepler. We introduced a synthetic flare injection and recovery subroutine to ascribe detection and energy recovery rates for flares in a broad energy range for each light curve. We collected a sample of 1 761 stars, mostly late-K to mid-M dwarfs and found 751 flare candidates with energies ranging from \$4\textbackslash cdot10\^\{32\}\$ erg to \$6\textbackslash cdot10\^\{34\}\$ erg, of which 596 belong to M45, 155 to M44, and none to M67. We find that flaring activity depends both on \$T\_\textbackslash mathrm\{eff\}\$, and age. But all flare frequency distributions have similar slopes with \$\textbackslash alpha \textbackslash approx2.0-2.4\$, supporting a universal flare generation process. We discuss implications for the physical conditions under which flares occur, and how the sample's metallicity and multiplicity affect our results.},

With the advent of the high-volume, high-precision astrometric data from the Gaia satellite and the Gaia DR2 release, we can study the dynamical state of open clusters to an unprecedented degree. We primarily look at quantifying any signatures of bulk cluster rotation that may be still present within open clusters that was imparted from the collapse of their nascent molecular cloud. We form a 6-dimensional picture of the dynamical state of these open clusters using the available data. We analyze the bulk cluster of several open clusters, and discuss the implications as it relates to the resulting evolution of binary stars, as well as exotic stellar phenomena such as blue straggler stars.}

  abstract = {NGC 6811 is one of the four open clusters located in the Kepler spacecraft field of view. We obtained UBVRI photometry of the cluster on six nights (four of them photometric) with the 1.08 m Hall and 1.83 m Perkins telescopes at Lowell Observatory. The mean photometric precision ranges from better than 0.01 mag in the V , B \textendash{} V , V \textendash{} R , and V \textendash{} I indices among stars brighter than magnitude 15 to about 0.05 mag for U \textendash{} B at magnitude 18. We followed a Bayesian statistical approach using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to determine the cluster reddening, distance, age, and iron content from a maximum-likelihood fit to stellar isochrones. Using the Yale-Yonsei isochrones, we derived E ( B \textendash{} V ) = 0.066 {$\pm$} 0.025, ( m \textendash{} M ) V = 10.13 {$\pm$} 0.19, age = 1.06 {$\pm$} 0.19 Gyr, and Z = 0.012 {$\pm$} 0.004 ([Fe/H] = \textendash 0.18); with the Padova isochrones, we found E ( B \textendash{} V ) = 0.081 {$\pm$} 0.015, ( m \textendash{} M ) V = 10.31 {$\pm$} 0.11, age = 0.94 {$\pm$} 0.08 Gyr, and Z = 0.012 {$\pm$} 0.002 ([Fe/H] = \textendash 0.20). The uncertainties include possible errors in the photometric zero points of {$\pm$}0.01 mag, but do not include uncertainties in the models. Taking into account the differences between the two sets of models, we find the best estimate for the cluster parameters to be E ( B \textendash{} V ) = 0.074 {$\pm$} 0.024, ( m \textendash{} M ) V = 10.22 {$\pm$} 0.18, age = 1.00 {$\pm$} 0.17 Gyr, and Z = 0.012 {$\pm$} 0.004 ([Fe/H] = \textendash 0.19).},

Estimates of reddening, distance modulus, age and number of cluster members are included. Although the sample is considered representative of the discoverable clusters in the galaxy, the observed distribution is nonuniform because of interstellar obscuration. Cluster distribution in the galactic plane is found to be dominated by the locations of dust clouds rather than by spiral structure. The distributions of clusters as a function of age and richness class show that the lifetimes of poor clusters are much shorter than rich ones, and that clusters in the outer disk survive longer than those in the inner disk. An outer disk age which is only about 50\% the age of the globular clusters is indicated by cluster statistics. The thickening of the galactic disk with increasing galactocentric distance may be due to either a younger dynamical age or a lower gravitational potential in the outer regions.},

Utilizing photometric observations from the 1 m telescope at Mount Laguna Observatory and spectra from the WIYN 3.5 m telescope, we measure precise and accurate masses (\textasciitilde 1.6\% uncertainty) and radii (\textasciitilde 0.5\%) for the binary components. In addition, we discover a third star orbiting the binary with a period greater than 3000 days using radial velocities and Kepler eclipse timings. Because the stars in the eclipsing binary are near the cluster turnoff, they are evolving rapidly in size and are sensitive to age. With a metallicity of [Fe/H] = +0.09 {$\pm$} 0.03, we find the age of NGC 6819 to be about 2.4 Gyr from color-magnitude diagram (CMD) isochrone fitting and 3.1 {$\pm$} 0.4 Gyr by analyzing the mass-radius (M-R) data for this binary. The M-R age is above previous determinations for this cluster, but consistent within 1{$\sigma$} uncertainties. When the M-R data for the primary star of the additional cluster binary WOCS 23009 is included, the weighted age estimate drops to 2.5 {$\pm$} 0.2 Gyr, with a systematic uncertainty of at least 0.2 Gyr. The age difference between our CMD and M-R findings may be the result of systematic error in the metallicity or helium abundance used in models, or due to slight radius inflation of one or both stars in the WOCS 40007 binary. This is paper 56 of the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS).},

A background sky flux is estimated from {$\sim$}4500 pixels on each of the 84 CCD readout channels, and simple aperture photometry is performed on an optimal aperture for each star. Ancillary engineering data and diagnostic information extracted from the science data are used to remove systematic errors in the flux time series that are correlated with these data prior to searching for signatures of transiting planets with a wavelet-based, adaptive matched filter. Stars with signatures exceeding 7.1{$\sigma$} are subjected to a suite of statistical tests including an examination of each star's centroid motion to reject false positives caused by background eclipsing binaries. Physical parameters for each planetary candidate are fitted to the transit signature, and signatures of additional transiting planets are sought in the residual light curve. The pipeline is operational, finding planetary signatures and providing robust eliminations of false positives.},

The data consist of the first five quarters of science operations of Kepler, which cover about 13 months. The high-precision time-series data allow us to accurately extract the oscillation frequencies from the power spectrum. We find that the frequency of the maximum oscillation power, {$\nu$}max, and the mean large frequency separation, {$\Delta\nu$}, are around 106 and 9.4 {$\mu$}Hz, respectively. A regular pattern of radial and non-radial oscillation modes is identified by stacking the power spectra in an echelle diagram. We use the scaling relations of {$\Delta\nu$} and {$\nu$}max to estimate the preliminary asteroseismic mass, which is confirmed with the modeling result (M = 1.45 {$\pm$} 0.05 M ) using the Yale Rotating stellar Evolution Code (YREC7). In addition, we constrain the effective temperature, luminosity, and radius from comparisons between observational constraints and models. A number of mixed l = 1 modes are also detected and taken into account in our model comparisons. We find a mean observational period spacing for these mixed modes of about 58 s, suggesting that this red giant branch star is in the shell hydrogen-burning phase.},

In this paper, we discuss the utility of the phase shifts \texttheta{} from the eigenvalue condition for mixed modes as a tool to characterize dipolar mixed modes from the theoretical as well as the practical point of view. Unlike the coupling strength, whose variation in a given star is very small over the relevant frequency range, the phase shifts vary significantly for different modes. The analysis in terms of \texttheta{} can also provide a better understanding of the pressure and gravity radial order for a given mixed mode. Observed frequencies of the Kepler red-giant star KIC 3744043 are used to test the method. The results are very promising.},

It is located inside the solar circle, harbors a large population of binary stars, and possibly experienced prolonged star formation. The combination of all these properties is puzzling and poses the intriguing question of its origin.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} One possible scenario is that the cluster formed close to the Galactic Center and later migrated outward to its current location. In this work we study the cluster's orbit and investigate the possible migration processes that may have displaced NGC 6791 to its present-day position, under the assumption that it actually formed in the inner disk.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} To this aim we performed integrations of NGC 6791's orbit in a potential consistent with the main Milky Way parameters. In addition to analytical expressions for halo, bulge and disk, we also consider the effect of bar and spiral arm perturbations, which are expected to be very important for the disk dynamical evolution, especially inside the solar circle. Starting from state-of-the art initial conditions for NGC 6791, we calculated 1000 orbits back in time for about 1 Gyr turning different non-axisymmetric components of the global potential on and off. We then compared statistical estimates of the cluster's recent orbital parameters with the orbital parameters of 10\textsuperscript{4{$<$}sup/{$>$} test-particles originating close to the Galactic Center (with initial galocentric radii in the range of 3\textendash 5 kpc) and undergoing radial migration during 8 Gyr of forward integration.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We find that a model that incorporates a strong bar and spiral arm perturbations can indeed be responsible for the migration of NGC 6791 from the inner disk (galocentric radii of 3\textendash 5 kpc) to its present-day location. Such a model can provide orbital parameters that are close enough to the observed ones. However, the probability of this scenario as it results from our investigations is very low.}}}}}},

At higher frequencies, waves are no longer trapped in the stellar interior and become traveller waves. In this article, we study six pulsating solar-like stars at different evolutionary stages observed by the NASA Kepler mission. These high signal-tonoise targets show a peak structure that extends at very high frequencies and are good candidates for studying the transition region between the modes and interference peaks or pseudo-modes. Following the same methodology successfully applied on Sun-as-a-star measurements, we uncover the existence of pseudo-modes in these stars with one or two dominant interference patterns depending on the evolutionary stage of the star. We also infer their cut-off frequency as the midpoint between the last eigenmode and the first peak of the interference patterns. Using ray theory we show that, while the period of one of the interference patterns is very close to half the large separation, the period of the other interference pattern depends on the time phase of mixed waves, thus carrying additional information on the stellar structure and evolution.},

While it has been claimed that most of these stars are younger than the rest of the typical thick disk stars, we show evidence that they might be products of mass transfer in binary evolution, notably evolved blue stragglers. We took new measurements of the radial velocities in a sample of 26 stars from APOKASC, including 13 ``young'' stars and 13 ``old'' stars with similar stellar parameters but with masses below 1.2 M and found that more of the young stars appear to be in binary systems with respect to the old stars. Furthermore, we show that the young stars do not follow the expected trend of [C/H] ratios versus mass for individual stars. However, with a population synthesis of low-mass stars including binary evolution and mass transfer, we can reproduce the observed [C/N] ratios versus mass. Our study shows how asteroseismology of solar-type red giants provides us with a unique opportunity to study the evolution of field blue stragglers after they have left the main-sequence.},

From high-resolution spectra obtained with GRACES at Gemini North, we derived fundamental parameters and detailed chemical abundances of 23 elements from equivalent widths and synthesis analysis. By combining atmospheric stellar parameters with available asteroseismic data, we obtained the stellar mass, radius, and age. The data analysis reveals that KIC 9821622 is a Li-rich (A(Li)NLTE = 1.80 {$\pm$} 0.2) intermediate-mass giant star (M = 1.64 M ) located at the red giant branch near the luminosity bump. We find unexpectedly elevated abundances of Fe-peak and r-process elements. In addition, as previously reported, we find that this is a young star (2.37 Gyr) with unusually high abundances of {$\alpha$}-elements ([{$\alpha$}/Fe] = 0.31). The evolutionary status of KIC 9821622 suggests that its Li-rich nature is the result of internal fresh Li that is synthesized through the Cameron-Fowler mechanism near the luminosity bump. However, its peculiar enhancement of {$\alpha$}, Fe-peak, and r-process elements opens the possibility of external contamination by material enriched by a supernova explosion. Although it is less likely, planet accretion cannot be ruled out.},

We verify the integrity of the stellar parameters through comparisons with asteroseismic studies and Gaia parallaxes. We also recompute planetary radii for 2025 planet candidates. Because knowledge of planetary radii is often limited by uncertainties in stellar size, we improve the uncertainties in planet radii from typically 42\% to 12\%. We also leverage improved knowledge of stellar effective temperature to recompute incident stellar fluxes for the planets, now precise to 21\%, compared to a factor of two when derived from photometry.},

The transits were discovered using photometric data from the Kepler public data release. The LHS 6343 stellar system was previously identified as a single high proper motion M dwarf. We use adaptive optics imaging to resolve the system into two low-mass stars with masses 0.370 {$\pm$} 0.009 M and 0.30 {$\pm$} 0.01 M , respectively, and a projected separation of 0.55. High-resolution spectroscopy shows that the more massive component undergoes Doppler variations consistent with Keplerian motion, with a period equal to the transit period and an amplitude consistent with a companion mass of MC = 62.7 {$\pm$} 2.4 MJup. Based on our analysis of the transit light curve, we estimate the radius of the companion to be RC = 0.833 {$\pm$} 0.021 RJup, which is consistent with theoretical predictions of the radius of a {$>$}1 Gyr brown dwarf.},

  abstract = {We report here an analysis of the physical stellar parameters of the giant star HD 185351 using Kepler short-cadence photometry, optical and near infrared interferometry from CHARA, and high-resolution spectroscopy. Asteroseismic oscillations detected in the Kepler short-cadence photometry combined with an effective temperature calculated from the interferometric angular diameter and bolometric flux yield a mean density {$\rho$} = 0.0130 {$\pm$} 0.0003 {$\rho$} and surface gravity log g = 3.280 {$\pm$} 0.011. Combining the gravity and density we find R = 5.35 {$\pm$} 0.20 R and M = 1.99 {$\pm$} 0.23 M . The trigonometric parallax and CHARA angular diameter give a radius R = 4.97 {$\pm$} 0.07 R . This smaller radius, when combined with the mean stellar density, corresponds to a stellar mass 1.60 {$\pm$} 0.08 M , which is smaller than the asteroseismic mass by 1.6{$\sigma$} . We find that a larger mass is supported by the observation of mixed modes in our high-precision photometry, the spacing of which is consistent only for M 1.8 M . Our various and independent mass measurements can be compared to the mass measured from interpolating the spectroscopic parameters onto stellar evolution models, which yields a model-based mass M ,model = 1.87 {$\pm$} 0.07 M . This mass agrees well with the asteroseismic value, but is 2.6{$\sigma$} higher than the mass from the combination of asteroseismology and interferometry. The discrepancy motivates future studies with a larger sample of giant stars. However, all of our mass measurements are consistent with HD 185351 having a mass in excess of 1.5 M .},

  abstract = {Large datasets are increasingly common and are often difficult to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application.},

The purpose of this paper is to provide data and tools to predict how Gaia photometry is expected to be. To do so, we provide relationships among colours involving Gaia magnitudes (white light G, blue GBP, red GRP and GRVS bands) and colours from other commonly used photometric systems (Johnson-Cousins, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Hipparcos and Tycho). Methods: The most up-to-date information from industrial partners has been used to define the nominal passbands, and based on the BaSeL3.1 stellar spectral energy distribution library, relationships were obtained for stars with different reddening values, ranges of temperatures, surface gravities and metallicities. Results: The transformations involving Gaia and Johnson-Cousins V - IC and Sloan DSS g - z colours have the lowest residuals. A polynomial expression for the relation between the effective temperature and the colour GBP - GRP was derived for stars with Teff {$\geq$} 4500 K. For stars with Teff {$<$} 4500 K, dispersions exist in gravity and metallicity for each absorption value in g - r and r - i. Transformations involving two Johnson or two Sloan DSS colours yield lower residuals than using only one colour.

  abstract = {We present a new method for replacing the outermost layers of stellar models with interpolated atmospheres based on results from 3D simulations, in order to correct for structural inadequacies of these layers. This replacement is known as patching. Tests, based on 3D atmospheres from three different codes and interior models with different input physics, are performed. Using solar models, we investigate how different patching criteria affect the eigenfrequencies. These criteria include the depth, at which the replacement is performed, the quantity, on which the replacement is based, and the mismatch in Teff and log g between the un-patched model and patched 3D atmosphere. We find the eigenfrequencies to be unaltered by the patching depth deep within the adiabatic region, while changing the patching quantity or the employed atmosphere grid leads to frequency shifts that may exceed 1 {$\mu$}Hz. Likewise, the eigenfrequencies are sensitive to mismatches in Teff or log g. A thorough investigation of the accuracy of a new scheme, for interpolating mean 3D stratifications within the atmosphere grids, is furthermore performed. Throughout large parts of the atmosphere grids, our interpolation scheme yields sufficiently accurate results for the purpose of asteroseismology. We apply our procedure in asteroseismic analyses of four Kepler stars and draw the same conclusions as in the solar case: Correcting for structural deficiencies lowers the eigenfrequencies, this correction is slightly sensitive to the patching criteria, and the remaining frequency discrepancy between models and observations is less frequency dependent. Our work shows the applicability and relevance of patching in asteroseismology.},

These pulsations arise due to the various ongoing physical phenomena of the variables. Moreover, pulsations of the variables are identified through the visual inspection of their frequency-amplitude distributions. A total of 18 variables among the 28 known variables are showing the secondary pulsation modes. Furthermore, these pulsation modes do not occur for PV, EA, EB, Elliptical and semi-regular. In addition, the field variables seem to be the red-component-stars (RCS) for the studied cluster. The smoothness of the frequency-amplitude curves, signal to noise ratio and the significant limits are play major role for deciding the real peak or frequency values. We are not rejected those amplitude peak of parabolic patterns, for which, the amplitude is greater than then significant limit of variables. The weight of pulsation frequencies is given to be 0.5 for non full cyclic variation but the amplitude is greater than significant limit. Similarly, our present analysis does not support the HADS characteristics of previous known HADS stars within stellar cluster NGC 6866. We are also proposed to new correlation between the secondary pulsation modes (depending frequencies) and the absolute magnitude of known variables.},

The science goals are to catalog the white dwarfs in the cluster and measure the cluster luminosity and mass functions. These CFH12K data results represent the first of nineteen open star clusters which were imaged as a part of the CFHT Open Star Cluster Survey. We find a tight, very rich, main-sequence and turnoff consisting of over 2900 cluster stars in the V , B - V color-magnitude diagram (CMD). Main-sequence fitting of the unevolved cluster stars with the Hyades star cluster yields a distance modulus of ( m - M ) V = 12.30 {$\pm$} 0.12, for a reddening of E ( B - V ) = 0.10. These values are consistent with a newly calculated theoretical stellar isochrone of age 2.5 Gyr, which we take to be the age of the cluster. Both the depth gained in the photometry and the increased projected area of the CFH12K Mosaic CCD allow for detailed star counts in concentric annuli out to large angular radii. These indicate a much larger cluster extent ( R = 9 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcm.gif] farcm 5 {$\pm$} 1 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcm.gif] farcm 0), by a factor of 2 over some previous estimates. Incompleteness tests confirm a slightly negatively sloped luminosity function extending to faint ( V 23) magnitudes which is indicative of a dynamically evolved cluster. Further luminosity function and mass segregation tests indicate that low-mass objects ( M {$\leq$} 0.65 M {$\odot$} ) predominate in the outer regions of the cluster, 3 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcm.gif] farcm 5 {$\leq$} R {$\leq$} 9 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcm.gif] farcm 5. The estimation of the number of white dwarfs in NGC 6819, based on stellar evolution models, white dwarf cooling timescales, and conservation of star number arguments applied to the red giant stars of the cluster are in good agreement with the observed number. For those white dwarf candidates which pass both a statistical subtraction that removes background galaxies and field stars and a high star/galaxy confidence by using image classification, we show comparisons with white dwarf isochrones and cooling models which suggest the need for spectroscopy to confirm the white dwarf nature of the brighter objects. This is entirely feasible for all objects, before a statistical subtraction cut, with the current generation of 8 m\textendash class telescopes and multiobject spectrometers.},

  abstract = {We present this paper in conjunction with a companion paper as the first results in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Open Star Cluster Survey. This survey is a large BVR imaging data set of 19 open star clusters in our Galaxy. This data set was taken with the CFH12K mosaic CCD (42{${'}$} \texttimes{} 28{${'}$}), and the majority of the clusters were imaged under excellent photometric, subarcsecond seeing, conditions. The combination of multiple exposures extending to deep (V {$\sim$} 25) magnitudes with short ({$\leq$}10 s) frames allows for studies ranging from faint white dwarf stars to bright turnoff, variable, and red giant stars. The primary aim of this survey is to catalog the white dwarf stars in these clusters and establish observational constraints on the initial-final mass relationship for these stars and the upper mass limit to white dwarf production. Additionally, we hope to better determine the properties of the clusters, such as age and distance, and also test evolution and dynamical theories by analyzing luminosity and mass functions. In order to more easily incorporate these data in further studies, we have produced a catalog of positions, magnitudes, colors, and stellarity confidence for all stars in each cluster of the survey. This reduction, along with the computed calibration parameters for all three nights of the observing run will encourage others to use these data in different astrophysical studies outside of our goals. Additionally, the data set is reduced using the new TERAPIX photometric reduction package, PSFex, which is found to compare well with other packages. This paper is intended both as a source for the astronomical community to obtain information on the clusters in the survey and as a detailed reference of reduction procedures for further publications of individual clusters. We discuss the methods employed to reduce the data and compute the photometric catalog. We reserve both the scientific results for each individual cluster and global results from the study of the entire survey for future publications. The first of these further publications is devoted to the old rich open star cluster, NGC 6819, and appears as a companion paper in the same issue of the Journal.},

  abstract = {The initial-final mass relation represents a mapping between the mass of a white dwarf remnant and the mass that the hydrogen-burning main-sequence star that created it once had. The empirical relation thus far has been constrained using a sample of 40 stars in young open clusters, ranging in initial mass from 2.75 to 7 M{$\Sun$}, and shows a general trend that connects higher mass main-sequence stars with higher mass white dwarfs. In this paper, we present CFHT CFH12K photometric and Keck LRIS multiobject spectroscopic observations of a sample of 22 white dwarfs in two older open clusters, NGC 7789 (t = 1.4 Gyr) and NGC 6819 (t = 2.5 Gyr). We measure masses for the highest signal-to-noise ratio spectra by fitting the Balmer lines to atmosphere models and place the first direct constraints on the low-mass end of the initial-final mass relation. Our results indicate that the observed general trend at higher masses continues down to low masses, with Minitial = 1.6 M{$\Sun$} main-sequence stars forming Mfinal = 0.54 M{$\Sun$} white dwarfs. When added to our new data from the very old cluster NGC 6791, the relation is extended down to Minitial = 1.16 M{$\Sun$} (corresponding to Mfinal = 0.53 M{$\Sun$}). This extension of the relation represents a fourfold increase in the total number of hydrogen-burning stars for which the integrated mass loss can now be calculated from empirical data, assuming a Salpeter initial mass function. The new leverage at the low-mass end is used to derive a purely empirical initial-final mass relation. The sample of white dwarfs in these clusters also shows several interesting systems that we discuss further: a DB (helium) white dwarf, a magnetic white dwarf, a DAB (mixed hydrogen/helium atmosphere or a double degenerate DA+DB) white dwarf(s), and two possible equal-mass DA double degenerate binary systems.},

  abstract = {NGC 6791 is a unique stellar system; it is both one of the oldest and  most metal-rich open clusters in our Galaxy. Recently, a deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging study of its white dwarf (WD) population has led to the puzzling conclusion that the cluster is only 2.4 Gyr old (the main-sequence turnoff age is {$>$}8 Gyr). To explain this discrepancy, it has been proposed that a fraction of the red giant branch stars in NGC 6791 may have lost enough mass during their ascent (due to the high metallicity, [Fe/H] \texttildelow{} +0.4) to avoid the helium (He) flash. Therefore, a fraction of the WD population in this cluster may not be canonical Carbon-Oxygen (C-O) core stars and rather be undermassive He-core stars. To test this, we obtained Keck/LRIS spectroscopy of a dozen bright WDs in NGC 6791 and measured their masses from Balmer line fitting. Our results indicate that most of the bright WDs in NGC 6791 are in fact undermassive and therefore were likely formed from this unique evolutionary channel.},

After a brief review of some of the pioneering work that established the importance of imaging stars in these systems, we focus on several recent studies that have challenged our fundamental picture of star clusters. These new studies indicate that star clusters can very well harbour multiple stellar populations, possibly formed through self-enrichment processes from the first-generation stars that evolved through post-main-sequence evolutionary phases. Correctly interpreting stellar evolution in such systems is tied to our understanding of both chemical-enrichment mechanisms, including stellar mass loss along the giant branches, and the dynamical state of the cluster. We illustrate recent imaging, spectroscopic and theoretical studies that have begun to shed new light on the evolutionary processes that occur within star clusters.},

  abstract = {We present the first detailed study of the properties (temperatures,  gravities, and masses) of the NGC 6791 white dwarf population. This unique stellar system is both one of the oldest (8 Gyr) and most metal-rich ([Fe/H]\textasciitilde +0.4) open clusters in our Galaxy and has a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) that exhibits both a red giant clump and a much hotter extreme horizontal branch. Fitting the Balmer lines of the white dwarfs in the cluster using Keck/LRIS spectra suggests that most of these stars are undermassive, =0.43+/-0.06 Msolar, and therefore could not have formed from canonical stellar evolution involving the helium flash at the tip of the red giant branch. We show that at least 40\% of NGC 6791's evolved stars must have lost enough mass on the red giant branch to avoid the flash and therefore did not convert helium into carbon-oxygen in their core. Such increased mass loss in the evolution of the progenitors of these stars is consistent with the presence of the extreme horizontal branch in the CMD. This unique stellar evolutionary channel also naturally explains the recent finding of a very young age (2.4 Gyr) for NGC 6791 from white dwarf cooling theory; helium-core white dwarfs in this cluster will cool \textasciitilde 3 times slower than carbon-oxygen-core stars, and therefore the corrected white dwarf cooling age is in fact {$>\sptilde$}7 Gyr, consistent with the well-measured main-sequence turnoff age. These results provide direct empirical evidence that mass loss is much more efficient in high-metallicity environments and therefore may be critical in interpreting the ultraviolet upturn in elliptical galaxies.

We fit the power density spectra of a large set of Kepler targets, determine the granulation and global oscillation parameter, and quantify scaling relations between them. Results. We establish that a depression in power at about {$\nu$}max/2, known from the Sun and a few other main-sequence stars, is also statistically significant in red giants and that a super-Lorentzian function with two components is best suited to reproducing the granulation signal in the broader vicinity of the pulsation power excess. We also establish that the specific choice of the background model can affect the determination of {$\nu$}max, introducing systematic uncertainties that can significantly exceed the random uncertainties. We find the characteristic frequency (i.e., inverse timescale) and amplitude of both background components to tightly scale with {$\nu$}max for a wide variety of stars (about 2\textendash 2000 {$\mu$}Hz in {$\nu$}max), and quantify a mass dependency of the latter. To enable comparison with theoretical predictions (which do not include the observed power depression), we computed effective timescales and bolometric intensity fluctuations and found them to approximately scale as {$\tau$}eff {$\propto$} g-0.85 T -0.4 and Agran {$\propto$} (g2 M)-1/4 (or more conveniently R/M3/4), respectively. Similarly, the bolometric pulsation amplitude scales approximately as Apuls {$\propto$} (g2 M)-1/3 (or R4/3/M), which implicitly verifies a separate mass and luminosity dependence of Apuls. We have also checked our scaling relations with solar reference values and find them in good agreement. Conclusions. We provide a thorough analysis of the granulation background signal in a large sample of stars, from which we establish a unified model that allows us to accurately extract the granulation and global oscillation parameter. The resulting scaling relations allow a simple estimate of the overall spectral shape of any solar-type oscillator and might serve as a starting point for future largesample studies or as a reference for theoretical modelling of granulation.},

Results. We re-examine the global oscillation parameters of the giants in the binary systems in order to determine their seismic fundamental parameters and we find them to agree with the dynamic parameters from the literature if we adopt non-linear scalings.

For about 6600 of them also APOGEE spectroscopic parameters are available, making the sample of high interest for various astrophysical investigations. To optimally exploit the full wealth of the seismic information, extraction of mode parameters of all significant individual frequencies is necessary. However, the complex structure of the mixed mode pattern makes it challenging to automate the peak bagging (i.e., the extraction of the individual mode parameters from the stars power density spectra). Even though several approaches have been successfully implemented, the available results are still limited to a handful of stars. Here I present frequencies, amplitudes, and lifetimes of more than a quarter of a million oscillation modes of the spherical degree l=0 to 3, which have been observed in 6179 Kepler red giants. The sample covers evolutionary stages from the lower red-giant branch to high up the asymptotic giant branch.

On the other hand, the brightest, otherwise well-studied stars, are lacking seismic characterization. Aims: Our goal is to use the granulation and/or oscillation time scales measured from photometric time series of bright red giants (1.6\$\textbackslash leq\$Vmag\$\textbackslash leq\$5.3) observed with BRITE to determine stellar surface gravities and masses. Methods: We use probabilistic methods to characterize the granulation and/or oscillation signal in the power density spectra and the autocorrelation function of the BRITE time series. Results: We detect a clear granulation and/or oscillation signal in 23 red giant stars and extract the corresponding time scales from the power density spectra as well as the autocorrelation function of the BRITE time series. To account for the recently discovered non-linearity of the classical seismic scaling relations, we use parameters from a large sample of Kepler stars to re-calibrate the scalings of the high- and low-frequency components of the granulation signal. We develop a method to identify which component is measured if only one granulation component is statistically significant in the data. We then use the new scalings to determine the surface gravity of our sample stars, finding them to be consistent with those determined from the autocorrelation signal of the time series. We further use radius estimates from the literature to determine the stellar masses of our sample stars from the measured surface gravities. We also define a statistical measure for the evolutionary stage of the stars.},

  abstract = {Three new photometric CCD-based datasets are presented for NGC\textasciitilde 6791. They consist of deep UBV photometry (to \$V\_\{lim\} =24\$, \$B\_\{lim\}=24\$, \$U\_\{lim\} = 23\$) of the central parts of the cluster and of selected fields around it, and of relatively shallower UBVI photometry for the whole cluster (\$23' \textbackslash times 23'\$). The data have been used to discuss the reddening, metallicity and age ofNGC\textasciitilde 6791, a cluster which is particularly important because of (1)\textasciitilde its most-advanced age among open clusters, (2)\textasciitilde metallicity higher than solar and (3)\textasciitilde particularly large number of member stars. We discovered two new very blue stars increasing the total of sdB objects in the cluster to ten. They are located in a very narrow range magnitudes \$V=17.7 \textbackslash pm 0.5\$; their blue colors strongly constrain our determination of the reddening of the cluster to \$E(B-V)=0.17 \textbackslash pm 0.01\$. We detected no other blue stars except a population of faint objects with \$V \textbackslash approx 22\$ in the center of the cluster. We have used the new theoretical isochrones in a differential determination of metallicity and age of NGC\textasciitilde 6791 using M67 and NGC\textasciitilde 188 as two clusters with well-known abundaces and age. We find \$[Fe/H] \textbackslash simeq +0.5\$ and age by 1\textasciitilde Gyr older than that of NGC\textasciitilde 188. The luminosity function of the cluster is surpisingly flat while the ``secondary'' main-sequence of equal-mass binaries is weaker than in less-populous old open clusters. We explain both features by the large total mass of the cluster which has lead to weak evaporation of low-mass and single stars from the cluster.},

The radial extent of NGC 6791 is at least 9.3 arcmin, and its central radius is r(c) about 124 arcsec. The contribution of the field stars to the different parts of the cluster color magnitude diagrams (V vs. B-V and V vs. V-I) is studied. NGC 6791 possesses about 47 blue stragglers and about 55 yellow stragglers. It harbors about 174 red giants, 22 of them horizontal branch stars. Seven candidates for sdB/sdO subdwarfs were discovered in the cluster field. Under assumption of cluster membership they possess M(v) between 3.6 and 4.8 and (B-V)0 between -0.35 and -0.14. The color index of the bluest sdB/sdO candidate provides an upper limit on the cluster reddening E(B-V = 0) not greater than 0.195. The observed luminosity function of NGC 6791 is more or less constant for V between 17.5 and 21.0 and then brakes due to increasing incompleteness of the photometry. The conservative lower limit on the cluster total mass is 4070 solar masses.},

The spectrum of this star outside the outburst, obtained by us with Multiple Mirror Telescope, clearly shows emission lines characteristic of dwarf novae. We observed the second star, known as B7, to undergo a large ( 3 mag) drop in its brightness over 10 days. The spectrum of B7 obtained in the high state resembles spectra of nova-like CVs. This star is likely a member of the UX UMa subtypes of CVs. Variables B7 and B8 represent only the second and the third cataclysmic variables known in open clusters. Variable B7 has observational characteristics that would make it difficult to identify as a CV with some of the methods currently being used in surveys for CVs in globular clusters.},

  abstract = {The physics governing the formation of star clusters is still not  entirely understood. One open question concerns the amount of angular momentum that newly formed clusters possess after emerging from their parent gas clouds. Recent results suggest an alignment of stellar spins and binary orbital spins in star clusters, which support a scenario in which clusters are born with net angular momentum cascading down to stellar scales. In this paper, we combine Gaia data and published line of sight velocities to explore if NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, two of the clusters for which an alignment of stellar spins has been reported, rotate in the same plane as their stars. We find evidence for rotation in NGC 6791 using both proper motions and line of sight velocities. Our estimate of the inclination angle is broadly consistent with the mean inclination that has been determined for its stars, but the uncertainties are still substantial. Our results identify NGC 6791 as a promising follow-up candidate to investigate the link between cluster and stellar rotation. We find no evidence for rotation in NGC 6819.},

  abstract = {Advances in asteroseismology of solar-like stars now provide a unique method to estimate the stellar inclination i . This enables to evaluate the spin\textendash orbit angle of transiting planetary systems in a complementary fashion to the Rossiter\textendash McLaughlin effect, a well-established method to estimate the projected spin\textendash orbit angle {$\lambda$}. Although the asteroseismic method has been broadly applied to the Kepler data, its reliability is yet to be assessed intensively. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of i from asteroseismology of solar-like stars using 3000 simulated power spectra. We find that the low-signal-to-noise ratio of the power spectra induces a systematic underestimate (overestimate) bias for stars with high (low) inclinations. We derive analytical criteria for the reliable asteroseismic estimate, which indicates that reliable measurements are possible in the range of 20{$\smwhtcircle$} i 80{$\smwhtcircle$} only for stars with high-signal-tonoise ratio. We also analyse and measure the stellar inclination of 94 Kepler main-sequence solar-like stars, among that 33 are planetary hosts. According to our reliability criteria, a third of them (nine with planets, 22 without) have accurate stellar inclination. Comparison of our asteroseismic estimate of vsin i against spectroscopic measurements indicates that the latter suffers from a large uncertainty possibly due to the modelling of macroturbulence, especially for stars with projected rotation speed vsin i 5 km s-1. This reinforces earlier claims, and the stellar inclination estimated from the combination of measurements from spectroscopy and photometric variation for slowly rotating stars needs to be interpreted with caution.},

We present measurements of chromospheric emission in 234 planet candidate systems from the Kepler mission. This ensemble includes 37 systems with giant-planet candidates, which show a clear emission enhancement. The enhancement, however, disappears when systems that are also identified as eclipsing binary candidates are removed from the ensemble. This suggests that a large fraction of the giant-planet candidate systems with chromospheric emission stronger than the Sun are not giant-planet systems, but false positives. Such false-positive systems could be tidally interacting binaries with strong chromospheric emission. This hypothesis is supported by an analysis of 188 eclipsing binary candidates that show increasing chromospheric emission as function of decreasing orbital period.},

  abstract = {By combining ground-based spectrographic observations of variability in the chromospheric emission from Sun-like stars with the variability seen in their eigenmode frequencies, it is possible to relate the changes observed at the surfaces of these stars to the changes taking place in the interior. By further comparing this variability to changes in the relative flux from the stars, one can obtain an expression for how these activity indicators relate to the energy output from the stars. Such studies become very pertinent when the variability can be related to stellar cycles as they can then be used on improve our understanding of the solar cycle and its effect on the energy output from the Sun. Here we present observations of chromospheric emission in 20 Sun-like stars obtained over the course of the nominal 4-year Kepler mission. Even though 4 years is not short to detect stellar cycles, observations from the Kepler mission can still be used to analyse the variability of the different activity indicators thereby obtaining information of the physical mechanism generating the variability. The analysis reveals no strong correlation between the different activity indicators, except in very few cases. We suggest that this is due to the sparse sampling of our ground-based observations on the one hand and that we are likely not tracing cyclic variability on the other hand. We also discuss how to improve the situation.},

  abstract = {We present the discovery of non-radial pulsations in a hot subdwarf B star based on 30.5 d of nearly continuous time series photometry using the Kepler spacecraft. KIC 010139564 is found to be a short-period pulsator of the V361 Hya (EC 14026) class with more than 10 independent pulsation modes whose periods range from 130 to 190 s. It also shows one periodicity at a period of 3165 s. If this periodicity is a high-order g-mode, then this star may be the hottest member of the hybrid DW Lyn stars. In addition to the resolved pulsation frequencies, additional periodic variations in the light curve suggest that a significant number of additional pulsation frequencies may be present. The long duration of the run, the extremely high duty cycle and the well-behaved noise properties allow us to explore the stability of the periodic variations, and to place strong constraints on how many of them are independent stellar oscillation modes. We find that most of the identified periodicities are indeed stable in phase and amplitude, suggesting a rotation period of 2\textendash 3 weeks for this star, but further observations are needed to confirm this suspicion.},

  abstract = {The survey phase of the Kepler Mission includes a number of hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars to search for non-radial pulsations. We present our analysis of two sdB stars that are found to be g-mode pulsators of the V1093 Her class. These two stars also display the distinct irradiation effect typical of sdB stars with a close M-dwarf companion with orbital periods of less than half a day. Because the orbital period is so short, the stars should be in synchronous rotation, and if so, the rotation period should imprint itself on the multiplet structure of the pulsations. However, we do not find clear evidence for such rotational splitting. Though the stars do show some frequency spacings that are consistent with synchronous rotation, they also display multiplets with splittings that are much smaller. Longer-duration time series photometry will be needed to determine if those small splittings are in fact rotational splitting, or caused by slow amplitude or phase modulation. Further data should also improve the signal-to-noise ratio, perhaps revealing lower-amplitude periodicities that could confirm the expectation of synchronous rotation. The pulsation periods seen in these stars show period spacings that are suggestive of high-overtone g-mode pulsations.},

Nevertheless, it is possible to disentangle them by identifying rotationally split doublets from one component and triplets from the other. The identification is helped by the presence of additive combination frequencies in the spectrum that involve the doublets but not the triplets. The rotational splittings of the multiplets imply core rotation periods of about 11 and 7 d in the two stars. One of the stars also shows evidence of = 2 modes.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses an algorithm for detecting single transits in photometric time-series data. Specifically, we aim to identify asymmetric transits with ingress that is more rapid than egress, as expected for cometary bodies with a significant tail. The algorithm is automated, so can be applied to large samples and only a relatively small number of events need to be manually vetted. We applied this algorithm to all long cadence light curves from the Kepler mission, finding 16 candidate transits with significant asymmetry, 11 of which were found to be artefacts or symmetric transits after manual inspection. Of the 5 remaining events, four are the 0.1\% depth events previously identified for KIC 3542116 and 11084727. We identify HD 182952 (KIC 8027456) as a third system showing a potential comet transit. All three stars showing these events have H-R diagram locations consistent with \$\textbackslash sim\$100Myr-old open cluster stars, as might be expected given that cometary source regions deplete with age, and giving credence to the comet hypothesis. If these events are part of the same population of events as seen for KIC 8462852, the small increase in detections at 0.1\% depth compared to 10\% depth suggests that future work should consider whether the distribution is naturally flat, or if comets with symmetric transits in this depth range remain undiscovered. Future searches relying on asymmetry should be more successful if they focus on larger samples and young stars, rather than digging further into the noise.},

  abstract = {The importance of studying the Gaia DR2 parallax zero-point by external means was underlined by Lindegren et al. (2018), and initiated by several works making use of Cepheids, eclipsing binaries, and asteroseismology. Despite a very efficient elimination of basic-angle variations, a small fluctuation remains and shows up as a small offset in the Gaia DR2 parallaxes. By combining astrometric, asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and photometric constraints, we undertake a new analysis of the Gaia parallax offset for nearly 3000 red-giant branch (RGB) and 2200 red clump (RC) stars observed by Kepler, as well as about 500 and 700 red giants (both RGB and RC) selected by the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program in campaigns 3 and 6. Engaging into a thorough comparison of the astrometric and asteroseismic parallaxes, we are able to highlight the influence of the asteroseismic method, and measure parallax offsets in the Kepler field that are compatible with independent estimates from literature and open clusters. Moreover, adding the K2 fields to our investigation allows us to retrieve a clear illustration of the positional dependence of the zero-point, in general agreement with the information provided by quasars. Lastly, we initiate a two-step methodology to make progress in the simultaneous calibration of the asteroseismic scaling relations and of the Gaia DR2 parallax offset, which will greatly benefit from the gain in precision with the third Data Release of Gaia.},

  abstract = {Aims: On the basis of the PPMXL star catalogue we performed a  survey of star clusters in the second quadrant of the Milky Way.  Methods: From the PPMXL catalogue of positions and proper motions we took the subset of stars with near-infrared photometry from 2MASS and added the remaining 2MASS stars without proper motions (called 2MAst, i.e. 2MASS with astrometry). We developed a data-processing pipeline including interactive human control of a standardised set of multi-dimensional diagrams to determine kinematic and photometric membership probabilities for stars in a cluster region. The pipeline simultaneously produced the astrophysical parameters of a cluster. From literature we compiled a target list of presently known open and globular clusters, cluster candidates, associations, and moving groups. From established member stars we derived spatial parameters (coordinates of centres and radii of the main morphological parts of clusters) and cluster kinematics (average proper motions and sometimes radial velocities). For distance, reddening, and age determination we used specific sets of theoretical isochrones. Tidal parameters were obtained by a fit of three-parameter King profiles to the observed density distributions of members. Results: We investigated all 871 objects in the 2nd Galactic quadrant, of which we successfully treated 642 open clusters, 2 globular clusters, and 8 stellar associations. The remaining 219 objects (24\%) were recognised by us to be nonexistent clusters, duplicate entries, or clusters too faint for 2MAst. We found that our sample is complete in the 2nd quadrant up to a distance of 2 kpc, where the average surface density is 94 clusters per kpc2. Compared with literature values we found good agreement in spatial and kinematic data, as well as for optical distances and reddening. Small, but systematic offsets were detected in the age determination.

The integrated magnitudes and colours are accurate to about 0.8 and 0.2 mag, respectively. Based on the sample of open clusters we construct the general cluster luminosity function in the solar neighbourhood in the three passbands. In each passband the CLF shows a linear part covering a range of 6 to 7 mag at the bright end. The CLFs reach their maxima at an absolute magnitude of -2 mag, then drop by one order of magnitude. During cluster evolution, the CLF changes its slope within tight, but well-defined limits. The CLF of the youngest clusters has a steep slope of about 0.4 at bright magnitudes and a quasi-flat portion for faint clusters. For the oldest population, we find a flatter function with a slope of about 0.2. The CLFs at Galactocentric radii smaller than that of the solar circle differ from those in the direction of the Galactic anti-centre. The CLF in the inner area is flatter and the cluster surface density higher than the local one. In contrast, the CLF is somewhat steeper than the local one in the outer disk, and the surface density is lower.}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {An all-sky target list of 3784 entries with initial cluster parameters  was compiled from sources available in the literature. As the primary source we used the data from the Catalogue of Open Cluster Data (COCD, Kharchenko et al. 2005a,b, Cat. J/A+A/438/1163, J/A+A/440/403). For further optical clusters the data were taken from the Dias et al. (2002, Cat. B/ocl) list (Version 3.1, 24/nov/2010). Known associations were retrieved from Melnik \& Dambis (2009, Cat. J/MNRAS/400/518). For clusters detected in the NIR the information came from Bica et al. (2003b, Cat. J/A+A/404/223), Dutra et al. (2003, Cat. J/A+A/400/533), Froebrich et al. (2007, Cat. J/MNRAS/374/399). Globular clusters were selected from the catalogue by Harris (1996, edition 2010, 2010arXiv1012.3224H). Additionally, we incorporated supplementary data on embedded clusters from Bica et al. (2003a, Cat. J/A+A/397/177), Lada \& Lada (2003ARA\&A..41...57L) and on stars in associations from Humphreys (1978, Cat. V/44). The basic stellar data were taken from the all-sky catalogue 2MAst (2Mass with Astrometry), that was extracted from the all-sky catalogues PPMXL (Roeser et al. 2010, Cat. I/317) and 2MASS (Cutri et al. 2003, Cat. II/246). Additionally, we incorporated data on radial velocities from Kharchenko et al. (2007, Cat. III/254) and spectral types from ASCC-2.5 (Kharchenko \& Roeser 2009, Cat. I/280). Around each object from our target list we defined a circular area with a radius of ra=r2+radd where r2 is the cluster radius, and radd=0.3\textdegree. In these areas we selected in 2MAst only those stars with flags Rflg (the 2nd triple of the flags in 2MASS) set to 1, 2, or 3 in each band, i.e. the stars with the best quality detections in photometric and astrometric data. There are 3784 targets in our object list, we confirmed 3006 clusters and/or associations. These 3006 sky areas contain about 63.5 mln 2MAst stars with best quality detections in photometric and astrometric data. We selected about 0.14 mln most probable members located in the central cluster regions and determined - with a homogeneous method/pipeline - angular sizes of the main morphological parts, heliocentric distances, colour-excesses, mean proper motions, ages, tidal parameters, sometimes radial velocities and metallicities. We present for the Milky Way: The Catalogue of the MWSC Data with: Catalogue of parameters for confirmed clusters; Index (full list) of MWSC objects; Notes (full object list with notes); Inside each list the entries are sorted by MWSC numbers (i.e. right ascension J2000 from the target list).

The white dwarf cooling ages of our targets range from 7 Myr for J1657+2056 to 10.3 Gyr for J1049-7400. The latter provides a firm lower limit of 10.3 Gyr for the age of the inner halo based on the well-understood physics of white dwarfs.

Some comparisons of theory and observation are made, particularly with respect to the period-luminosity relation, location of variables in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, fundamental versus first overtone mode, and phase relations between light and velocity curves. A number of special problems are discussed, including causes of the limitation of the pulsation amplitude to the observed values, relations between the light and velocity variations, and the interaction between pulsations and convection.

In the absence of a definitive model for convection, which is thought to be the mechanism that excites these oscillations, the amplitudes for both velocity and luminosity measurements must be estimated by scaling from the Sun. In the case of luminosity measurements, even this is difficult because of disagreement over the solar amplitude. This last point has lead us to investigate whether the luminosity amplitude of oscillations {$\delta$}L/L can be derived from the velocity amplitude (v\_osc\_). Using linear theory and observational data, we show that p-mode oscillations in a large sample of pulsating stars satisfy ({$\delta$}L/L)\_bol\_\{prop.to\} v\_osc\_/T\_eff\_. Using this relationship, together with the best estimate of v\_osc\_,sun\_=(23.4+/-1.4)cm/s, we estimate the luminosity amplitude of solar oscillations at 550nm to be {$\delta$}L/L=(4.7+/-0.3)ppm. Next we discuss how to scale the amplitude of solar-like (i.e., convectively-powered) oscillations from the Sun to other stars. The only predictions come from model calculations by Christensen-Dalsgaard \& Frandsen (1983, Sol. Phys. 82, 469). However, their grid of stellar models is not dense enough to allow amplitude predictions for an arbitrary star. Nevertheless, although convective theory is complicated, we might expect that the general properties of convection - including oscillation amplitudes - should change smoothly through the colour-magnitude diagram. Indeed, we find that the velocity amplitudes predicted by the model calculations are well fitted by the relation v\_osc\_\{prop.to\}L/M. These two relations allow us to predict both the velocity and luminosity amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in any given star. We compare these predictions with published observations and evaluate claims for detections that have appeared in the literature. We argue that there is not yet good evidence for solar-like oscillations in any star except the Sun. For solar-type stars (e.g., {$\alpha$} Cen A and {$\beta$} Hyi), observations have not yet reached sufficient sensitivity to detect the amplitudes we predict. For some F-type stars, namely Procyon and several members of M67, detection sensitivities 30-40\% below the predicted amplitudes have been achieved. We conclude that these stars must oscillate with amplitudes less than has generally been assumed.},

  abstract = {We present a simple diagnostic that can be used to constrain the location of the differential rotation in red giants with measured mixed mode rotational splittings. Specifically, in red giants with radii {$\sim$}4 R , the splittings of p-dominated modes (sound wave-dominated) relative to those of g-dominated modes (internal gravity wave-dominated) are sensitive to how much of the differential rotation resides in the outer convection zone versus the radiative interior of the red giant. An independently measured surface rotation rate significantly aids breaking degeneracies in interpreting the measured splittings. We apply our results to existing observations of red giants, particularly those of Kepler-56, and find that most of the differential rotation resides in the radiative region rather than in the convection zone. This conclusion is consistent with results in the literature from rotational inversions, but our results are insensitive to some of the uncertainties in the inversion process and can be readily applied to large samples of red giants with even a modest number of measured rotational splittings. We argue that differential rotation in the radiative interior strongly suggests that angular momentum transport in red giants is dominated by local fluid instabilities rather than large-scale magnetic stresses.},

There are two known processes that can create these objects: direct stellar collisions and binary evolution. However, the relative importance of these processes has remained unclear. In particular, the total number of blue stragglers found in a given cluster does not seem to correlate with the predicted collision rate, providing indirect support for the binary-evolution model. Yet the radial distributions of blue stragglers in many clusters are bimodal, with a dominant central peak: this has been interpreted as an indication that collisions do dominate blue straggler production, at least in the high-density cluster cores. Here we report that there is a clear, but sublinear, correlation between the number of blue stragglers found in a cluster core and the total stellar mass contained within it. From this we conclude that most blue stragglers, even those found in cluster cores, come from binary systems. The parent binaries, however, may themselves have been affected by dynamical encounters. This may be the key to reconciling all of the seemingly conflicting results found to date.},

  abstract = {Though stars within the same cluster all typically form around the same time, they dont all evolve in the same way. A recent study has carefully explored a population of particularly unusual, straggling stars in the old open cluster Collinder 261.This Hubble image of the globular cluster NGC 6362 reveals a number of stars that appear younger and bluer than their companions: so-called blue stragglers. [ESA/Hubble  NASA]Why So Blue?A stellar cluster is typically born in a burst of star formation that creates member stars from the same source material. After the stars form, the cluster ages over cosmic time, its individual stars evolving according to their masses. Bright, blue, massive stars have short lifespans, evolving quickly off the main sequence; dim, red, low-mass stars live much longer and evolve slowly. This difference causes clusters to become progressively redder as they age.For particularly old clusters, we would not expect to see any bright blue stars, as these should have all aged off the main sequence already. And yet, again and again, we find handfuls of these bright blue stars  in the Milky Ways globular and open clusters, and even in other nearby galaxies. How do these so-called blue stragglers arise?Oh, to Be Young AgainTwo possible formation channels for blue stragglers: two stars collide (top), or a star gains mass from a binary companion (bottom). [NASA/ESA]Since blue-straggler stars are more massive and brighter than expected for their host cluster, we think they must have gained that mass more recently. There are two proposed rejuvenation scenarios that could create blue stragglers:Two stars collide and merge to form one massive star.A star gains mass from a close-binary companion.By studying populations of blue stragglers and exploring these possibilities, we have the potential opportunity to learn about about cluster dynamics and histories, and about binary systems. But blue stragglers tend to lie near the very crowded centers of galaxies  which makes it difficult to observe individual stars and be certain of their membership in the cluster.Led by Maria Rain (University of Padua, Italy), a team of scientists has now met this challenge using the precise stellar measurements of the Gaia mission in conjunction with spectroscopy from an instrument on ESOs Very Large Telescope in Chile. The team conducted one of the most detailed studies of a blue straggler population, exploring the open cluster Collinder 261.Stars of a Different ColorProper motions for Collinder 261. Black circles are cluster members; blue circles are blue straggler candidates, and orange circles are yellow straggler candidates. [Adapted from Rain et al. 2020]Aged at 7 to 9.3 billion years, Collinder 261 is one of the oldest open clusters of the Milky Way. Rain and collaborators used Gaia data describing the colors and brightnesses, the proper motions, and the parallaxes of stars in Collinder 261s field to identify 53 blue straggler candidates and one potential yellow straggler  an evolved blue straggler  in the cluster. The authors then followed up 10 of these stars with spectroscopic measurements, determining that at least five of them are members of close binary systems.While these data are not yet enough to draw firm conclusions about the origin of blue stragglers, it should be possible to spectroscopically follow up the remaining candidate stars to learn more. This study provides a particularly detailed exploration of these odd straggling stars, which we can hope to build on in the near future.CitationA study of the blue straggler population of the old open cluster Collinder 261, M.

Besides being of great importance for our understanding of RR Lyrae stars in general, these RR Lyr data can be regarded as a case study for observations of bright stars with Kepler. Kepler can perform high-precision photometry on targets like RR Lyr, as the saturated flux is conserved to a very high degree. The Kepler data on RR Lyr are revolutionary in several respects. Even with long-cadence sampling (one measurement per 29.4 min), the unprecedented precision ({$<$} mmag) of the Kepler photometry allows the study of the star's extreme light-curve variations in detail. The multiplet structures at the main frequency and its harmonics, typical for Blazhko stars, are clearly detected up to the quintuplets. For the first time, photometric data of RR Lyr reveal the presence of half-integer frequencies, linked to a period-doubling effect. This phenomenon may be connected to the still unexplained Blazhko modulation. Moreover, with three observed Blazhko cycles at our disposal, we observe that there is no exact repetition in the light-curve changes from one modulation cycle to the next for RR Lyr. This may be due to additional periodicities in the star, or to transient or quasi-periodic changes.},

  abstract = {The frequency of low-mass pre-main sequence binary systems is significantly lower in the Trapezium Cluster than in Taurus-Auriga. We investigate if this difference can be explained through stellar encounters in dense clusters. To this effect, a range of possible models of the well observed Trapezium Cluster are calculated using Aarseth's direct N-body code, which treats binaries accurately. The results are confronted with observational constraints. The range of models include clusters in virial equilibrium, expanding clusters as a result of instantaneous mass loss, as well as collapsing clusters. In all cases the primordial binary proportion is larger than 50 per cent, with initial period distributions as observed in Taurus-Auriga and the Galactic field. It is found that the expanding model, with an initial binary population as in the Galactic field, is most consistent with the observational constraints. This raises the possibility that the primordial group of OB stars may have expelled the cluster gas roughly 50000 yr ago. The cluster's bulk expansion rate is thus a key observable that needs to be determined. The other models demonstrate that the rapidly decreasing binary proportion, its radial dependence and the form of the period distribution, together with structural and kinematical data, are very useful diagnostics on the present and past dynamical state of a young cluster. In particular, kinematical cooling from the disruption of wide binaries is seen for the first time.},

  abstract = {The formation of globular clusters (GCs) remains one of the main unsolved problems in star and galaxy formation. The past decades have seen important progress in constraining the physics of GC formation from a variety of directions. In this article, we discuss the latest constraints obtained from studies of present-day GC populations, the formation of young massive clusters (YMCs) in the local Universe, and the observed, large-scale conditions for star and cluster formation in high-redshift galaxies. The main conclusion is that the formation of massive, GC progenitor clusters is restricted to high-pressure environments similar to those observed at high redshift and at the sites of YMC formation in the local Universe. However, the correspondingly high gas densities also lead to efficient cluster disruption by impulsive tidal shocks, which limits the survival of GCs progenitor clusters. As a result, the long-term survival of GC progenitor clusters requires them to migrate into the host galaxy halo on a short time-scale. It is proposed that the necessary cluster migration is facilitated by the frequent galaxy mergers occurring at high redshift. We use the available observational and theoretical constraints to condense the current state of the field into a coherent picture of GC formation, in which regular star and cluster formation in high-redshift galaxies naturally leads to the GC populations observed today.},

Here, we review observations and theoretical models for the formation, evolution, and eventual disruption of star clusters. Current literature suggests a picture of this life cycle including the following several phases: Clusters form in hierarchically structured, accreting molecular clouds that convert gas into stars at a low rate per dynamical time until feedback disperses the gas. The densest parts of the hierarchy resist gas removal long enough to reach high star-formation efficiency, becoming dynamically relaxed and well mixed. These remain bound after gas removal. In the first {$\sim$}100 Myr after gas removal, clusters disperse moderately fast, through a combination of mass loss and tidal shocks by dense molecular structures in the star-forming environment. After {$\sim$}100 Myr, clusters lose mass via two-body relaxation and shocks by giant molecular clouds, processes that preferentially affect low-mass clusters and cause a turnover in the cluster mass function to appear on {$\sim$}1-10-Gyr timescales. Even after dispersal, some clusters remain coherent and thus detectable in chemical or action space for multiple galactic orbits.In the next decade, a new generation of space- and adaptive optics-assisted ground-based telescopes will enable us to test and refine this picture.},

  abstract = {Mixture models combine multiple components into a single probability density function. They are a natural statistical model for many situations in astronomy, such as surveys containing multiple types of objects, cluster analysis in various data spaces, and complicated distribution functions. This chapter in the CRC Handbook of Mixture Analysis is concerned with astronomical applications of mixture models for cluster analysis, classification, and semi-parametric density estimation. We present several classification examples from the literature, including identification of a new class, analysis of contaminants, and overlapping populations. In most cases, mixtures of normal (Gaussian) distributions are used, but it is sometimes necessary to use different distribution functions derived from astrophysical experience. We also address the use of mixture models for the analysis of spatial distributions of objects, like galaxies in redshift surveys or young stars in star-forming regions. In the case of galaxy clustering, mixture models may not be the optimal choice for understanding the homogeneous and isotropic structure of voids and filaments. However, we show that mixture models, using astrophysical models for star clusters, may provide a natural solution to the problem of subdividing a young stellar population into subclusters. Finally, we explore how mixture models can be used for mathematically advanced modeling of data with heteroscedastic uncertainties or missing values, providing two example algorithms, the measurement error regression model of Kelly (2007) and the Extreme Deconvolution model of Bovy et al. (2011). The challenges presented by astronomical science, aided by the public availability of catalogs from major surveys and missions, are a rich area for collaboration between statisticians and astronomers.},

  abstract = {We consider the tidal excitation of modes in a binary system of arbitrary eccentricity. For a circular orbit, the modes generally undergo forced oscillation with a period equal to the orbital period (T). For an eccentric orbit, the amplitude of each tidally excited mode can be written approximately as the sum of an oscillatory term that varies sinusoidally with the mode frequency and a "static" term that follows the time dependence of the tidal forcing function. The oscillatory term falls off exponentially with increasing b (defined as the ratio of the periastron passage time to the mode period), whereas the "static" term is independent of b{$\alpha$}. For small-b{$\alpha$} modes (b{$\alpha$} {$\asymp$} 1), the two terms are comparable, and the magnitude of the mode amplitude is nearly constant over the orbit. For large-b{$\alpha$} modes (b{$\alpha$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} a few), the oscillatory term is very small compared with the "static" term, in which case the mode amplitude, like the tidal force, varies as the distance cubed. For main-sequence stars, p-, f-, and low-order g-modes generally have large b{$\alpha$} and hence small amplitudes of oscillation. High overtone g-modes, however, have small overlap with the tidal forcing function. Thus, we expect an intermediate overtone g-mode with b{$\alpha$} \texttildelow{} 1 to have the largest oscillation amplitude. In addition, we find that the mode amplitude is independent of the dissipation rate except when the mode frequency is very close to orbital resonance or the damping time is less than T; both conditions are unlikely. Moreover, orbital evolution causes a resonant mode to move off resonance with time. This severely limits the amplitude of modes near resonance. Rotation of the star shifts the mode frequencies but otherwise has little effect on the mode amplitude (provided that the rotation rate is small). Hence, tidally excited modes have amplitudes and phases that are periodic with period T, making them readily distinguishable from oscillations excited by other mechanisms. We apply our work to the SMC radio pulsar PSR J0045 - 7319, which is believed to be in a highly eccentric orbit with a 10 Msun B star. We find that the g7 mode (with period 1.07 days) of the B star has the largest oscillation amplitude, with a flux variation of 2.3 mmag and a surface velocity of 70 ms-1. The flux variation at periastron summed over all modes, is about 10 mmag; in addition, we propose that the shape of the light curve can be utilized to determine the orbital inclination angle. The apsidal motion of this system, calculated without the usual static approximation, is larger than that predicted by the classical apsidal formula by about 1\%. For the PSR B1259 - 63 system, the tidal amplitude of the Be star companion is smaller by a factor of 70 because of its larger periastron distance. To understand the dependence of tidal excitation on stellar structure, detailed numerical calculations of modes of a general polytropic star are also presented.},

Importantly, both of the giants have been classified as core He-burning red clump (RC) stars based on asteroseismic data from Kepler mission. Also, both of the stars are found to be low mass (M {$\approx$} 1.0 Me), which, together with an evidence of their evolutionary status of being RC stars, implies that the stars have gone through both the luminosity bump and He-flash during their red giant branch (RGB) evolution. The stars' large Li abundance and evolutionary phase suggest that Li enrichment occurred very recently, probably at the tip of the RGB either during He-flash, an immediate preceding event on the RGB, or by some kind of external event such as merger of an RGB star with white dwarf. The findings will provide critical constraints to theoretical models for understanding of Li enhancement origin in RGB stars.},

This gives the first robust determination of the rotation of the deep core and surface of a main-sequence star, essentially model independently.

A strong angular momentum transfer mechanism must be operating to produce the nearly rigid rotation, and a mechanism other than viscosity must be operating to produce a more rapidly rotating surface than core. Our asteroseismic result, along with previous asteroseismic constraints on internal rotation in some B stars, and measurements of internal rotation in some subgiant, giant and white dwarf stars, has made angular momentum transport in stars throughout their lifetimes an observational science.},

  abstract = {We have discovered a new rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) star among the Kepler mission target stars, KIC 10195926. This star shows two pulsation modes with periods that are amongst the longest known for roAp stars at 17.1 and 18.1 min, indicating that the star is near the terminal-age main sequence. The principal pulsation mode is an oblique dipole mode that shows a rotationally split frequency septuplet that provides information on the geometry of the mode. The secondary mode also appears to be a dipole mode with a rotationally split triplet, but we are able to show within the improved oblique pulsator model that these two modes cannot have the same axis of pulsation. This is the first time for any pulsating star that evidence has been found for separate pulsation axes for different modes. The two modes are separated in frequency by 55 {$\mu$}Hz, which we model as the large separation. The star is an {$\alpha$}2 CVn spotted magnetic variable that shows a complex rotational light variation with a period of Prot = 5.684 59 d. For the first time for any spotted magnetic star of the upper main sequence, we find clear evidence of light variation with a period of twice the rotation period, that is, a subharmonic frequency of {$\nu$}rot/2. We propose that this and other subharmonics are the first observed manifestation of torsional modes in an roAp star. From high-resolution spectra, we determine Teff = 7400 K, log g = 3.6 and v sin i = 21 km s-1. We have found a magnetic pulsation model with fundamental parameters close to these values that reproduces the rotational variations of the two obliquely pulsating modes with different pulsation axes. The star shows overabundances of the rare earth elements, but these are not as extreme as most other roAp stars. The spectrum is variable with rotation, indicating surface abundance patches.},

Oscillations in 1-D and 2-D are introduced here, leading to 3-D descriptions of the changing shapes of pulsating star.

  abstract = {There are many Slowly Pulsating B (SPB) stars and {$\gamma$} Dor stars in the Kepler mission data set. The light curves of these pulsating stars have been classified phenomenologically into stars with symmetric light curves and with asymmetric light curves. In the same effective temperature ranges as the {$\gamma$} Dor and SPB stars, there are variable stars with downward light curves that have been conjectured to be caused by spots. Among these phenomenological classes of stars, some show `frequency groups' in their amplitude spectra that have not previously been understood. While it has been recognized that non-linear pulsation gives rise to combination frequencies in a Fourier description of the light curves of these stars, such combination frequencies have been considered to be a only a minor constituent of the amplitude spectra. In this paper, we unify the Fourier description of the light curves of these groups of stars, showing that many of them can be understood in terms of only a few base frequencies, which we attribute to g-mode pulsations, and combination frequencies, where sometimes a very large number of combination frequencies dominate the amplitude spectra. The frequency groups seen in these stars are thus tremendously simplified. We show observationally that the combination frequencies can have amplitudes greater than the base frequency amplitudes, and we show theoretically how this arises. Thus for some {$\gamma$} Dor and SPB stars, combination frequencies can have the highest observed amplitudes. Among the B stars are pulsating Be stars that show emission lines in their spectra from occasional ejection of material into a circumstellar disc. Our analysis gives strong support to the understanding of these pulsating Be stars as rapidly rotating SPB stars, explained entirely by g-mode pulsations.},

In the amplitude spectrum of the p-mode pulsations, we also discovered an FM signal compatible with a third body in the system, a low-mass M dwarf in an 861-d orbit around the primary pair. However, the eclipses show no timing variations, indicating that the FM signal is a consequence of the intrinsic change in pulsation frequency, thus providing a cautionary tale. Our analysis shows the potential of the FM technique using Kepler data, and we discuss the prospects to detect planets and brown dwarfs in Kepler data for A and F stars even in the absence of transits and with no spectroscopic radial velocity curves. This opens the possibility of finding planets orbiting hotter stars that cannot be found by traditional techniques.},

  abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within {$\sim$}2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4\textendash 7\% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M{$\odot$}. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70\textendash 90\%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

We used models in order to investigate the effects of these mechanisms on the asymptotic period spacing of gravity modes ( 1) of red-giant stars that ignite He burning in degenerate conditions (M 2.0 M ). We also compare the predictions of these models with Kepler observations. For a given {$\nu$}, 1 depends not only on the stellar mass, but also on mixing processes that can affect the structure of the core. We find that in the case of more evolved red-giant-branch stars and regardless of the transport processes occurring in their interiors, the observed 1 can provide information as to their stellar luminosity, within {$\sim$}10\textendash 20 per cent. In general, the trends of 1 with respect to mass and metallicity that are observed in Kepler red-giant stars are well reproduced by the models.},

  abstract = {Star clusters are known to have smaller intrinsic metallicity spreads than dwarf galaxies due to their shorter star formation timescales. Here we use individual spectroscopic [Fe/H] measurements of stars in 19 Local Group dwarf galaxies, 13 Galactic open clusters, and 49 globular clusters to show that star cluster and dwarf galaxy linear metallicity distributions are binomial in form, with all objects showing strong correlations between their mean linear metallicity \textbackslash bar\{Z\} and intrinsic spread in metallicity {$\sigma$}(Z)\textsuperscript{2}. A plot of {$\sigma$}(Z)\textsuperscript{2} versus \textbackslash bar\{Z\} shows that the correlated relationships are offset for the dwarf galaxies from the star clusters. The common binomial nature of these linear metallicity distributions can be explained with a simple inhomogeneous chemical evolution model, where the star cluster and dwarf galaxy behavior in the \textbackslash sigma (Z)\^\{2\}-\textbackslash bar\{Z\} diagram is reproduced in terms of the number of enrichment events, covering fraction, and intrinsic size of the enriched regions. The inhomogeneity of the self-enrichment sets the slope for the observed dwarf galaxy \textbackslash sigma (Z)\^\{2\}-\textbackslash bar\{Z\} correlation. The offset of the star cluster sequence from that of the dwarf galaxies is due to pre-enrichment, and the slope of the star cluster sequence represents the remnant signature of the self-enriched history of their host galaxies. The offset can be used to separate star clusters from dwarf galaxies without a priori knowledge of their luminosity or dynamical mass. The application of the inhomogeneous model to the \textbackslash sigma (Z)\^\{2\}-\textbackslash bar\{Z\} relationship provides a numerical formalism to connect the self-enrichment and pre-enrichment between star clusters and dwarf galaxies using physically motivated chemical enrichment parameters. Therefore we suggest that the \textbackslash sigma (Z)\^\{2\}-\textbackslash bar\{Z\} relationship can provide insight into what drives the efficiency of star formation and chemical evolution in galaxies, and is an important prediction for galaxy simulation models to reproduce.},

  abstract = {We study the accuracy of spectroscopic RVs by comparing spectroscopic and astrometric RVs for stars of the Hyades open cluster. Rather accurate astrometric RVs are available for the Hyades' stars, based on Hipparcos and on the first Gaia data release. We obtained HARPS spectra for a large sample of Hyades stars, and homogeneously analysed them. After cleaning the sample from binaries, RV variables, and outliers, 71 stars remained. The distribution of the observed RV difference (spectroscopic -- astrometric) is skewed and depends on the star right ascension. This is consistent with the Hyades cluster rotating at 42.3 +/- 10 m/s/pc. The two Hyades giants in the sample show, as predicted by gravitational redshift (GR), a spectroscopic RV that is blue-shifted with respect to the dwarfs, and the empirical GR slope is of 626 +/- 131 m/s, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. The difference between spectroscopic and astrometric RVs is very close to zero, within the uncertainties. In particular, the mean difference is of -33 m/s and the median is of -16 m/s when considering the Gaia-based RVs (corrected for cluster rotation), with a sigma of 347 m/s, very close to the expected cluster velocity dispersion. We also determine a new value of the cluster centroid spectroscopic RV: 39.36 +/- 0.26 km/s. The spectroscopic RV measurements are expected, from simulations, to depend on stellar rotation, but our data do not confirm these predictions. We finally discuss other phenomena that can influence the RV difference, such as cluster expansion, stellar activity, general relativity, and Galactic potential. Clusters within the reach of current telescopes are expected to show differences of several hundreds m/s, depending on their position in the Galaxy.},

Including a starspot on either of the components, light-curve synthesis indicates that this system is a semi-detached Algol with a mass ratio of 0.211, an orbital inclination of 73\textdegree. 9, and a large temperature difference of 2534 K. To examine in detail both the spot variations and pulsations, we separately analyzed the Kepler time-series data at the interval of an orbital period in an iterative way. The results reveal that the variable asymmetries of the light maxima can be interpreted as the changes with time of a magnetic cool spot on the secondary component. Multiple frequency analyses were performed in the outside-eclipse light residuals after removal of the binarity effects from the observed Kepler data. We detected 30 frequencies with signal to noise amplitude ratios larger than 4.0, of which six ( f2\textendash f6 and f10) can be identified as high-order (17n25) low-degree ({$\mathscr{l}$}=2) gravity-mode pulsations that were stable during the observing run of 200 days. In contrast, the other frequencies may be harmonic and combination terms. For the six frequencies, the pulsation periods and pulsation constants are in the ranges of 0.352\textendash 0.506 days and 0.232\textendash 0.333 days, respectively. These values and the position on the Hertzsprung\textendash Russell diagram demonstrate that the primary star is a {$\gamma$} Dor variable.

Our spectra, with signal-to-noise per pixel (SNR) ranging from 60 to 300, span the luminosity range from the tip of the red giant branch to a point two magnitudes below the top of the cluster turnoff. We derive radial and rotational velocities for all stars, as well as [Fe/H] based on 17 iron lines, [Ca/H], [Si/H], and [Ni/H] in the 247 most probable, single members of the cluster. Input temperature estimates for model atmosphere analysis are provided by (B-V) colors merged from several sources, with individual reddening corrections applied to each star relative to a cluster mean of E(B-V) = 0.16. Extensive use is made of ROBOSPECT, an automatic equivalent width measurement program; its effectiveness on large spectroscopic samples is discussed. From the sample of likely single members, [Fe/H] = -0.03 +/- 0.06, where the error describes the median absolute deviation about the sample median value, leading to an internal precision for the cluster below 0.01 dex. The final uncertainty in the cluster abundance is therefore dominated by external systematics due to the temperature scale, surface gravity, and microturbulent velocity, leading to [Fe/H] = -0.02 +/- 0.02 for a sub-sample restricted to main sequence and turnoff stars. This result is consistent with our recent intermediate-band photometric determination of a slightly subsolar abundance for this cluster. [Ca/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ni/Fe] are determined to be solar within the uncertainties. NGC 6819 has an abundance distribution typical of solar metallicity thin disk stars in the solar neighborhood.},

  abstract = {KIC 7177553 was observed by the Kepler satellite to be an eclipsing eccentric binary star system with an 18-day orbital period. Recently, an eclipse timing study of the Kepler binaries has revealed eclipse timing variations (ETVs) in this object with an amplitude of {$\sim$}100 sand an outer period of 529 days. The implied mass of the third body is that of a super-Jupiter, but below the mass of a brown dwarf. We therefore embarked on a radial velocity (RV) study of this binary to determine its system configuration and to check the hypothesis that it hosts a giant planet. From the RV measurements, it became immediately obvious that the same Kepler target contains another eccentric binary, this one with a 16.5-day orbital period. Direct imaging using adaptive optics reveals that the two binaries are separated by 0 4 ({$\sim$}167 AU)and have nearly the same magnitude (to within 2\%). The close angular proximity of the two binariesand very similar {$\gamma$} velocitiesstrongly suggest that KIC 7177553 is one of the rare SB4 systems consisting of two eccentric binaries where at least one system is eclipsing. Both systems consist of slowly rotating, nonevolved, solar-like stars of comparable masses. From the orbital separation and the small difference in {$\gamma$} velocity, we infer that the period of the outer orbit most likely lies in the range of1000\textendash 3000 yr. New images taken over the next few years, as well as the high-precision astrometry of the Gaia satellite mission, will allow us to set much narrower constraints on the system geometry.

  abstract = {For a sample of 38 Galactic globular clusters (GCs), we confront the observed distributions of blue straggler (BS) proper motions and masses (derived from isochrone fitting) from the BS catalog of Simunovic \& Puzia with theoretical predictions for each of the two main competing BS formation mechanisms. These are mass transfer from an evolved donor on to a main-sequence (MS) star in a close binary system, and direct collisions involving MS stars during binary encounters. We use the \textbackslash texttt\{FEWBODY\} code to perform simulations of single-binary and binary-binary interactions. This provides collisional velocity and mass distributions for comparison to the observed distributions. Most clusters are consistent with BSs derived from a dynamically relaxed population, supportive of the binary mass-transfer scenario. In a few clusters, including all the post-core collapse clusters in our sample, the collisional velocities provide the best fit.},

  abstract = {Color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of open clusters reveal many stars that do not fall on standard isochrones, and thus are not evolving according to standard theory. The most numerous of these are the blue straggler stars (BSSs), stars brighter and bluer than the cluster turnoff that are likely formed from binary mass transfer, stellar mergers, or collisions during dynamical encounters. Many other non-standard stars are also found in fclusters, but their origins are not well understood. These include the `yellow stragglers' found between the BSS region and the red giant branch, and `sub-subgiants' found fainter and redder than the giant branch. Using the 4 Gyr open cluster M67 as an exemplar, I present results of the first comprehensive study to move beyond the BSS population and begin to understand these other types of non-standard stars. First, I present an asteroseismic analysis of a yellow straggler in M67, demonstrating that it is an evolved blue straggler star of twice the cluster turnoff mass. Next, I present theoretical formation models for the sub-subgiant stars. I focus on three hypotheses of sub-subgiant formation: Roche lobe overflow in binary systems, rapid envelope mass loss from subgiant stars, e.g. during grazing dynamical encounters, and inhibition of convection in giant stars with strong magnetic fields. Finally, I use K2 light curves to identify stars on the M67 main sequence with unusually fast rotation rates given the old age of the cluster. I hypothesize that these stars have been spun up due to recent mergers, collisions, or episodes of mass-transfer, and thus represent lower-luminosity analogs to the blue stragglers. Together, these studies present a much more complete view of the post-merger, collision, and mass-transfer population of M67, and demonstrate that BSSs account for only about half of the post-interaction population. These stars represent the early stages of binary evolution pathways that may lead to many astrophysically important objects including X-ray binaries, double degenerates, and Type 1a supernovae. Studying these products of binary evolution across cluster CMDs is a critical step towards developing better models of binary evolutionary pathways and understanding the impact of binaries on stellar populations.},

  abstract = {At an age of 4 Gyr, typical solar-type stars in M67 have rotation rates of 20-30 days. Using K2 Campaign 5 and 16 light curves and the spectral archive of the WIYN Open Cluster Study, we identify eleven three-dimensional kinematic members of M67 with anomalously fast rotation periods of 2-8 days, implying ages of less than 1 Gyr. We hypothesize that these anomalously fast rotators have been spun up by mass transfer, mergers, or stellar collisions during dynamical encounters within the last Gyr, and thus represent lower-luminosity counterparts to the blue straggler stars. These 11 candidate post-interaction stellar systems have much in common with the blue stragglers including a high binary fraction (73\%), a number of long-period, low-eccentricity binary systems, and in at least one case a UV excess consistent with the presence of a hot white dwarf companion. The identification of these 11 systems provides the first picture of the low-luminosity end of the blue straggler distribution, providing new constraints for detailed binary evolution models and cluster population studies. This result also clearly demonstrates the need to properly account for the impact of binaries on stellar evolution, as significant numbers of post-interaction binaries likely exist on cluster main sequences and in the field. These stars are not always easy to identify, but make up \textasciitilde 10\% of the spectroscopic binary population among the solar-type stars in M67.},

YSSs may represent a population of evolved blue stragglers, but none have the direct and precise mass and radius measurements needed to determine their evolutionary states and formation histories. Here we report the first asteroseismic mass and radius measurements of such a star, the yellow straggler S1237 in the open cluster M67. We apply asteroseismic scaling relations to a frequency analysis of the Kepler K2 light curve and find a mass of2.9 {$\pm$} 0.2 M {$\odot$} and a radius of9.2 {$\pm$} 0.2 R {$\odot$} . This is more than twice the mass of the main-sequence turnoff in M67, suggesting that S1237 is indeed an evolved blue straggler. S1237 is the primary in a spectroscopic binary. We update the binary orbital solution and use spectral energy distribution fitting to constrain the CMD location of the secondary star. We find that the secondary is likely an upper main-sequence star near the turnoff, but a slightly hotter blue straggler companion is also possible. We then compare the asteroseismic mass of the primary to its mass from CMD fitting, finding that the photometry implies a mass and radius more than 2 {$\sigma$} below the asteroseismic measurement. Finally, we consider formation mechanisms for this star and suggest that S1237 may have formed from dynamical encounters resulting in stellar collisions or a binary merger.},

Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we develop evolutionary tracks for each of these hypotheses, and compare the expected stellar and orbital properties of these models with six known SSGs in the two open clusters M67 and NGC 6791. All three of these mechanisms can create stars or binary systems in the SSG CMD domain. We also calculate the frequency with which each of these mechanisms may create SSG systems, and find that the magnetic field hypothesis is expected to create SSGs with the highest frequency in open clusters. Mass transfer and envelope stripping have lower expected formation frequencies, but may nevertheless create occasional SSGs in open clusters. They may also be important mechanisms to create SSGs in higher mass globular clusters.},

By combining photometry and projected rotational velocities from the literature of stars in \$h\$ and \$\textbackslash chi\$ Persei, we find no obvious relation between the rotational velocities and colors of non-emission-line eMSTO stars, in contrast with what is observed in older clusters. Similarly to what is observed in Magellanic Cloud clusters, most of the extremely rapidly rotating stars, identified by their strong H\$\textbackslash alpha\$ emission lines, are located in the red part of the eMSTOs. This indicates that stellar rotation plays a role in the color and magnitude distribution of MSTO stars. By comparing the observations with simulated CMDs, we find that a simple population composed of coeval stars that span a wide range of rotation rates is unable to reproduce the color spread of the clusters' MSs. We suggest that variable stars, binary interactions, and stellar rotation affect the eMSTO morphology of these very young clusters.},

High-quality observations of eclipsing binary stars observed by Kepler offer a great opportunity to calibrate model parameters for evolved stars. Our study focuses on six Kepler red giants with the goal of calibrating the mixing-length parameter of convection as well as the asteroseismic surface term in models. We introduce a new method to improve the identification of oscillation modes that exploits theoretical frequencies to guide the mode identification (`peak-bagging') stage of the data analysis. Our results indicate that the convective mixing-length parameter ({$\alpha$}) is {$\approx$}14 per cent larger for red giants than for the Sun, in agreement with recent results from modelling the APOGEE stars. We found that the asteroseismic surface term (i.e. the frequency offset between the observed and predicted modes) correlates with stellar parameters (Teff, log g) and the mixing-length parameter. This frequency offset generally decreases as giants evolve. The two coefficients a-1 and a3 for the inverse and cubic terms that have been used to describe the surface term correction are found to correlate linearly. The effect of the surface term is also seen in the p\textendash g mixed modes; however, established methods for correcting the effect are not able to properly correct the g-dominated modes in late evolved stars.},

The period spacings of both show a linear relation with the pulsation period but the slope is negative for the gravity modes and positive for the Rossby modes. Most Rossby modes have k = -2, m = -1 and only one series of k = -1, m = -1 modes is seen. For each pattern, the mean pulsation period, the mean period spacing, and the slope are measured. We find the slope correlates with the mean period for Rossby patterns. The traditional approximation of rotation is used to fit the near-core rotation rate assuming the star rotates rigidly.

  abstract = {Rossby modes are a newly-noticed oscillation mode in the rotating fluid, whose restoring force is the Coriolis force. They give a new method to understand the rotation of stars, which presently hinders asteroseismic modelling, but is still poorly-observed. We report 70 {$\gamma$} Doradus stars containing clear period spacing patterns of both gravity and Rossby modes. The period spacings of both show a linear relation with the pulsation period but the slope is negative for the gravity modes and positive for the Rossby modes. Most Rossby modes are k = -2, m = -1 modes and only one series of k = -1, m = -1 modes is seen. For each pattern, the mean pulsation period, the mean period spacing, and the slope are measured. We find the slope correlates with the mean period for Rossby patterns. The traditional approximation of rotation is used to fit the near-core rotation rate assuming the star rotates rigidly. We report the nearcore rotation rates, the asymptotic spacings, and the radial orders of excited modes of these 70 main-sequence stars. The near-core rotation rates are between 0.6 d-1 and 2.3 d-1.

We performed asteroseismic analysis on six solar-like stars observed by the Kepler mission: KIC 6064910, KIC 6766513, KIC 7107778, KIC 10079226, KIC 10147635 and KIC 12069127. The extraction of seismic information includes two parts. First, we obtained two global asteroseismic parameters, mean large separation {$\increment\nu$} and frequency of maximum power {$\nu$}max, with autocorrelation function and collapsed autocorrelation function. Second, we extracted individual oscillation modes {$\nu$}nl with low-l degree using a least-squares fit. Stellar grid models were built with Yale Rotating Stellar Evolution Code (YREC) to analyze stellar properties. They covered the range of M = 0.8 {$\sim$} 1.8 M{$\odot$} with a step of 0.02 M{$\odot$} and [Fe/H] = -0.3 {$\sim$} 0.4 dex with a step of 0.1 dex. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate stellar fundamental parameters of the six stars, under the constraints of asteroseismic parameters ({$\increment\nu$}, {$\nu$}max) and non-asteroseismic parameters (Teff, [Fe/H]). We discover that the six targets include five sub-giant stars with 1.2 {$\sim$} 1.5 M{$\odot$} and one main-sequence star with 1.08 M{$\odot$}, and with ages in the range of 3 {$\sim$} 5 Gyr.},

  abstract = {Stellar populations contain the most important information about star cluster formation and evolution. Until several decades ago, star clusters were believed to be ideal laboratories for studies of simple stellar populations (SSPs). However, discoveries of multiple stellar populations in Galactic globular clusters have expanded our view on stellar populations in star clusters. They have simultaneously generated a number of controversies, particularly as to whether young star clusters may have the same origin as old globular clusters. In addition, extensive studies have revealed that the SSP scenario does not seem to hold for some intermediate-age and young star clusters either, thus making the origin of multiple stellar populations in star clusters even more complicated. Stellar population anomalies in numerous star clusters are well-documented, implying that the notion of star clusters as true SSPs faces serious challenges. In this review, we focus on stellar populations in massive clusters with different ages. We present the history and progress of research in this active field, as well as some of the most recent improvements, including observational results and scenarios that have been proposed to explain the observations. Although our current ability to determine the origin of multiple stellar populations in star clusters is unsatisfactory, we propose a number of promising projects that may contribute to a significantly improved understanding of this subject.},

  abstract = {Optical spectrophotometry of seven faint, extremely blue stars found by Kaluzny \& Udalski (1992) in the open cluster NGC 6791 is presented and analyzed using model atmosphere fits to the Balmer and He I line profiles. Four are subdwarf B (sdB) stars with 24000 K less than or approximately Teff less than or approximately 32 000 K and +4.3 less than or approximately Mv less than or approximately +4.5, at least three of which are likely to be extended horizontal branch (EHB) members of this old, metal-rich cluster. One is a subdwarf O star, Mv = +4.0, and could be a post-horizontal branch or AGB-manque star in the cluster. One cataclysmic variable is found, also a possible member. The brightest and coolest candidate is most likely a nonmember B star of lower gravity. As a by-product of the analysis, the mean reddening of the cluster is estimated to be E(B-V) = 0.14. These results imply that the core helium-burning, horizontal branch (HB) of NGC 6791 has an extremely bimodal distribution of hydrogen envelope mass. Most stars with total masses approximately 0.7 solar mass form a normal red 'clump' in the color-magnitude diagram, while greater than or approximately 15\% lie in a tight group on the EHB with very little (less than 0.01 solar mass) hydrogen envelope overlying the approximately 0.5 solar mass core. It is difficult to see how such a large fraction of EHB stars with almost identically small envelope masses could have been produced by single star mass loss rates with any reasonable dispersion. It seems equally difficult to understand how a binary mass transfer mechanism could be so fine-tuned. Though we cannot satisfactorily explain the unusual HB morphology in NGC 6791, the EHB stars in this younger, metal-rich disk cluster must have formed in a much lower density environment under a very different set of circumstances than their globular cluster counterparts. We further suggest that the similar sdB/EHB stars of the field are produced mainly by the most metal-rich component of the disk population. In support of this hypothesis, there seem to be few, if any, EHB stars in old open clusters of solar metallicity or less. The implied far-ultraviolet (less than 2000 A) radiation appropriate for the hot, evolved population of NGC 6791 will yield an integrated cluster LUV/ Lbol comparable to those observed in the metal-rich elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges. Since the stellar sources in the latter may come from a population similar to NGC 6791 in metallicity, age, and stellar density, we suggest that a like fraction of evolved, hot stars exists in the unresolved extragalactic populations. Current data are consistent with the working hypothesis that the trend of increasing far-UV radiation with increasing metallicity found for elliptical galaxies may also apply to the galactic disk.},

Interestingly, we find that 70.0 {$\pm$} 6.6\% of the planets in this regime are inner components of multiplanetary systems. This value is 4.2{$\sigma$} higher than for main-sequence hosts, which we find to be 42.4 {$\pm$} 0.1\%. The properties of the known planets seem to indicate that the closest-in planets (a {$<$} 0.06 au) to main-sequence stars are massive (i.e., hot Jupiters) and isolated and that they are subsequently engulfed by their host as it evolves to the red giant branch, leaving only the predominant population of multiplanetary systems in orbits 0.06 {$<$} a {$<$} 0.5 au. We discuss the implications of this emerging observational trend in the context of formation and evolution of hot Jupiters.},

We analysed Kepler photometry to 1) re-calculate transit parameters; 2) study the light-curve modulations; and 3) to perform an asteroseismic analysis (accurate stellar parameter determination) by identifying solar-like oscillations on the periodogram. We also used a high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum obtained with the Calar Alto Fiber-fed \'Echelle spectrograph (CAFE) to measure stellar properties. Additionally, false-positive scenarios were rejected by obtaining high-resolution images with the AstraLux lucky imaging camera on the 2.2 m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory. Results. We confirm the planetary nature of the object transiting the star Kepler-91 by deriving a mass of Mp = 0.88-+00..3137 MJup and a planetary radius of Rp = 1.384-+00..005141 RJup. Asteroseismic analysis produces a stellar radius of R = 6.30 {$\pm$} 0.16 R and a mass of M = 1.31 {$\pm$} 0.10 M . We find that its eccentric orbit (e = 0.066-+00..001173) is just 1.32-+00..2027 R away from the stellar atmosphere at the pericentre. We also detected three small dims in the phase-folded light curve. The combination of two of them agrees with the theoretical characteristics expected for secondary eclipse. Conclusions. Kepler-91b could be the previous stage of the planet engulfment, which has recently been detected for BD+48 740. Our estimations show that Kepler-91b will be swallowed by its host star in less than 55 Myr. Among the confirmed planets around giant stars, this is the closest to its host star. At pericentre, the star subtends an angle of 48{$\smwhtcircle$}, covering around 10\% of the sky as seen from the planet. The planetary atmosphere seems to be inflated probably due to the high stellar irradiation.},

These data were calculated in two steps. First, the satellite attitude and the astrometric calibration parameters of the CCDs were obtained in an astrometric global iterative solution for 16 million selected sources, using about 1\% of the input data. This primary solution was tied to the extragalactic International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) by means of quasars. The resulting attitude and calibration were then used to calculate the astrometric parameters of all the sources. Special validation solutions were used to characterise the random and systematic errors in parallax and proper motion. {$<$}BR /{$>$} Results: For the sources with five-parameter astrometric solutions, the median uncertainty in parallax and position at the reference epoch J2015.5 is about 0.04 mas for bright (G \&lt; 14 mag) sources, 0.1 mas at G = 17 mag, and 0.7 masat G = 20 mag. In the proper motion components the corresponding uncertainties are 0.05, 0.2, and 1.2 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1}, respectively.The optical reference frame defined by Gaia DR2 is aligned with ICRS and is non-rotating with respect to the quasars to within 0.15 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1}. From the quasars and validation solutions we estimate that systematics in the parallaxes depending on position, magnitude, and colour are generally below 0.1 mas, but the parallaxes are on the whole too small by about 0.03 mas. Significant spatial correlations of up to 0.04 mas in parallax and 0.07 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1} in proper motion are seen on small (\&lt; 1 deg) and intermediate (20 deg) angular scales.

Key to this time-stamping is the cluster NGC 6791, whose stellar members have mean abundances that place it in the high- {$\alpha$} , high-[Fe/H] region of the [ {$\alpha$} /Fe]\textendash [Fe/H] plane. Based on the cluster's age ({$\sim$}8 Gyr), Galactocentric radius, and height above the Galactic plane, as well as comparable chemistry reported for APOGEE stars in Baade's Window, we suggest that the two most likely origins for NGC 6791 are as an original part of the thick disk, or as a former member of the Galactic bulge. Moreover, because NGC 6791 lies at the high-metallicity end ([Fe/H] {$\sim$} 0.4) of the high- {$\alpha$} sequence, the age of NGC 6791 places a limit on the youngest age of stars in the high-metallicity, high- {$\alpha$} sequence for the cluster's parent population (i.e., either the bulge or the disk). In a similar way, we can also use the age and chemistry of NGC 188 to set a limit of {$\sim$}7 Gyr on the oldest age of the low- {$\alpha$} sequence of the MW. Therefore, NGC 6791 and NGC 188 are potentially a pair of star clusters that bracket both the timing and the duration of an important transition point in the chemical history of the MW.},

Lett. 114 (2015) 054101] that the Kepler data includes ``golden'' stars, whose luminosities vary quasiperiodically with two frequencies nearly in the golden ratio, and whose secondary frequencies exhibit power-law scaling with exponent near -1.5, suggesting strange nonchaotic dynamics and singular spectra. Here we use a series of phenomenological models to make plausible the connection between golden stars and fractal spectra. We thereby suggest that at least some features of variable star dynamics reflect universal nonlinear phenomena common to even simple systems.},

We derived stellar parameters and differential chemical abundances for 19 elements (C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Ba) with uncertainties as low as {$\sim$}0.01\textendash 0.02 dex.

We demonstrate that none of these findings can be explained by errors due to the stellar parameters. Our results reveal that the Hyades is chemically inhomogeneous at the 0.02 dex level. Possible explanations for the abundance variations include (1) inhomogeneous chemical evolution in the proto-cluster environment, (2) supernova ejection in the proto-cluster cloud and (3) pollution of metal-poor gas before complete mixing of the proto-cluster cloud.

The results show that slight and significant systematic errors exist among the RVs obtained from the spectra collected by different spectrographs and exposures, respectively. After correcting the systematic errors with different techniques, the precision of RVs reaches \textasciitilde 1.3, \textasciitilde 1.0, \textasciitilde 0.5 and \textasciitilde 0.3 km/s at S/Nr = 10, 20, 50, and 100, respectively. Comparing with the RVs of the standard stars of the APOGEE survey, our RVs are calibrated with a zero-point shift of \textasciitilde 7 km/s.

We combined the second Gaia release with ground-based H-band parallaxes obtained with the infrared camera on the 2-m robotic Liverpool telescope to astrometrically identify stellar and sub-stellar members of the Hyades, the nearest open cluster to the Sun. We find 1764 objects within 70 degree radius from the cluster center from the Gaia second data release, whose kinematic properties are consistent with the Hyades. We limit our study to 30 pc from the cluster center (47.03+/-0.20 pc) where we identify 710 candidate members, including 85 and 385 in the core and tidal radius, respectively. We determine proper motions and parallaxes of eight candidate brown dwarf members and confirm their membership. Using the 3D positions and a model-based mass-luminosity relation we derive a luminosity and mass function in the 0.04 to 2.5 Msun range. We confirm evidence for mass segregation in the Hyades and find a dearth of brown dwarfs in the core of the cluster. From the white dwarf members we estimate an age of 640\$\^\{+67\}\_\{-49\}\$ Myr. We identify a list of members in the Hyades cluster from the most massive stars down to the brown dwarfs.

  abstract = {Observations of pressure-gravity mixed modes, combined with a theoretical framework for understanding mode formation, can yield a wealth of information about deep stellar interiors. In this paper, we seek to develop a formalism for treating the effects of deeply buried core magnetic fields on mixed modes in evolved stars, where the fields are moderate, i.e. not strong enough to disrupt wave propagation, but where they may be too strong for non-degenerate first-order perturbation theory to be applied. The magnetic field is incorporated in a way that avoids having to use this. Inclusion of the Lorentz force term is shown to yield a system of differential equations that allows for the magnetically affected eigenfunctions to be computed from scratch, rather than following the approach of first-order perturbation theory. For sufficiently weak fields, coupling between different spherical harmonics can be neglected, allowing for reduction to a second-order system of ordinary differential equations akin to the usual oscillation equations that can be solved analogously. We derive expressions for (i) the mixed-mode quantization condition in the presence of a field and (ii) the frequency shift associated with the magnetic field. In addition, for modes of low degree we uncover an extra offset term in the quantization condition that is sensitive to properties of the evanescent zone. These expressions may be inverted to extract information about the stellar structure and magnetic field from observational data.},

  abstract = {Stars are self-gravitating fluids in which pressure, buoyancy, rotation  and magnetic fields provide the restoring forces for global modes of oscillation. Pressure and buoyancy energetically dominate, while rotation and magnetism are generally assumed to be weak perturbations and often ignored. However, observations of anomalously weak dipole mode amplitudes in red giant stars suggest that a substantial fraction of these are subject to an additional source of damping localized to their core region, with indirect evidence pointing to the role of a deeply buried magnetic field. It is also known that in many instances, the gravity-mode character of affected modes is preserved, but so far, no effective damping mechanism has been proposed that accommodates this aspect. Here we present such a mechanism, which damps the oscillations of stars harbouring magnetised cores via resonant interactions with standing Alfv\'en modes of high harmonic index. The damping rates produced by this mechanism are quantitatively on par with those associated with turbulent convection, and in the range required to explain observations, for realistic stellar models and magnetic field strengths. Our results suggest that magnetic fields can provide an efficient means of damping stellar oscillations without needing to disrupt the internal structure of the modes, and lay the groundwork for an extension of the theory of global stellar oscillations that incorporates these effects.},

Here we analyze a sample of 66 Kepler main-sequence stars showing solar-like oscillations as part of the Kepler seismic LEGACY project. We use Kepler short-cadence data, of which each star has at least 12 months, to create frequency-power spectra optimized for asteroseismology. For each star, we identify its modes of oscillation and extract parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and line width using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo ``peak-bagging'' approach. We report the extracted mode parameters for all 66 stars, as well as derived quantities such as frequency difference ratios, the large and small separations Dn and dn02; the behavior of line widths with frequency and line widths at nmax with Teff, for which we derive parametrizations; and behavior of mode visibilities. These average properties can be applied in future peak-bagging exercises to better constrain the parameters of the stellar oscillation spectra. The frequencies and frequency ratios can tightly constrain the fundamental parameters of these solar-type stars, and mode line widths and amplitudes can test models of mode damping and excitation.},

The stellar evolutionary models are computed using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code with simple input physics. Results. We have compared the results from AME with results for three groups of stars: stars with radii determined from interferometry (and measured parallaxes), stars with radii determined from measurements of their parallaxes (and calculated angular diameters), and stars with results based on modelling their individual oscillation frequencies. We find that a comparison of the radii from interferometry to those from AME yields a weighted mean of the fractional differences of just 2\%. This is also the level of deviation that we find when we compare the parallax-based radii to the radii determined from AME. Conclusions. The comparison between independently determined stellar parameters and those found using AME show that our method can provide reliable stellar masses, radii, and ages, with median uncertainties in the order of 4\%, 2\%, and 25\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {We performed a time-series B, V band CCD photometric observations of the open cluster NGC 6811 to search for variable stars. A total number of 16 variables were detected including nine new ones. They are classified as 12 {$\delta$} Scuti stars and four unknown type variables. The 12 {$\delta$} Scuti variables are all very likely members of the cluster. This makes NGC 6811 a very important target for asteroseismology of dwarf Cepheids. In addition, we have carried out an isochrone fitting on the V vs. B\textendash V CMD of the cluster based on theoretical models. It gives an age of log(t)=8.76{$\pm$}0.09 for the cluster with the solar metallicity (Z=0.019). The distance modulus and color excess of NGC 6811 are determined to be (m-M)V=10.59{$\pm$}0.09 and E(B-V)=0.12{$\pm$}0.05, respectively. A preliminary Fourier analysis shows a few very interesting sequences of period-luminosity relations, with the fundamental mode matches the P\textendash L relation defined by previous studies for {$\delta$} Scuti variables with high precision observations. This also confirms that all the 12 {$\delta$} Scuti stars observed in this work are highly probable members of NGC 6811.},

  abstract = {Analysis of eclipsing binaries containing non-radial pulsators allows i) combining two different and independent sources of information on the internal structure and evolutionary status of the components and ii) studying the effects of tidal forces on pulsations. KIC 3858884 is a bright Kepler target whose light curve shows deep eclipses, complex pulsation patterns with pulsation frequencies typical of {$\delta$} Sct, and a highly eccentric orbit. We present the result of the analysis of Kepler photometry and of high resolution phaseresolved spectroscopy. Spectroscopy yielded both the radial velocity curves and, after spectral disentangling, the primary-component effective temperature and metallicity, and line-of-sight projected rotational velocities. The Kepler light curve was analyzed with an iterative procedure that was devised to disentangle eclipses from pulsations and takes the visibility of the pulsating star into account during eclipses. The search for the best set of binary parameters was performed by combining the synthetic light curve models with a genetic minimization algorithm, which yielded a robust and accurate determination of the system parameters. The binary components have very similar masses (1.88 and 1.86 M ) and effective temperatures (6800 and 6600 K), but different radii (3.45 and 3.05 R ). The comparison with the theoretical models showed a somewhat different evolutionary status of the components and the need to introduce overshooting in the models. The pulsation analysis indicates the hybrid nature of the pulsating (secondary) component, where the corresponding high order g-modes might be excited by an intrinsic mechanism or by tidal forces.},

  abstract = {We present a spectroscopic abundance analysis of the old, super-metal-rich open cluster NGC 6253, with emphasis on its O abundance. High-dispersion, 7774 \AA{} O i triplet region spectra of 47 stars were obtained using Hydra II on the CTIO Blanco 4 m. Radial velocity analysis confirms 39 stars consistent with single star membership, primarily at the turnoff. Thirty-six of these are included in our abundance analysis. Our differential analysis relative to the Sun yields primarily scaled-solar values, with weighted cluster averages of [O/H] = +0.440 {$\pm$} 0.020, [Fe/H] = +0.445 {$\pm$} 0.014, [Al/H] = +0.487 {$\pm$} 0.020, [Si/H] = +0.504 {$\pm$} 0.018, and [Ni/H] = +0.702 {$\pm$} 0.018 (where the errors are \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/149/4/141/aj510411ieqn1.gif] \$\textbackslash sigma \_\textbackslash mu \$ ). We discuss possible origins for the three known super-metal-rich clusters based upon their abundance patterns, Galactic locations, and space motions. The abundance patterns of NGC 6253 are very similar to those of NGC 6791 and NGC 6583. With the possible exception of oxygen, the abundances of these clusters are all close to scaled-solar, and they are similar to patterns seen in metal-rich disk dwarfs and giants. However, they also seem to differ from those of metal-rich bulge stars. We demonstrate that NGC 6253 is unusually oxygen rich (in [O/H]) for its 3.3 Gyr age. While we find [O/Fe] to be scaled-solar for NGC 6253, the more recently reported values for NGC 6791 show a large variation, from values close to scaled-solar down to values at least a factor of two below scaled-solar. We discuss the possibility that the scaled-solar [O/Fe] abundances of NGC 6253 and NGC 6791 might reflect a flattening of the Galactic [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relationship. This possibility may be consistent with disk star abundance data, which show an apparent ``floor'' at [O/Fe] \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/149/4/141/aj510411ieqn2.gif] \$\textbackslash sim -0.1\$ for [Fe/H] \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/149/4/141/aj510411ieqn3.gif] \$\textbackslash gt \textbackslash;0\$ , and with chemical evolution model results, which may predict such a flattening due to a decrease in supernova Fe yields at super-solar-metallicities. Orbit solutions for NGC 6791 allow that it may have formed in the inner disk and was then kicked out, but the origins of the other two much younger clusters remain mysterious. We re-evaluate the age of NGC 6583 in view of the evidence that the cluster is super-metal-rich, and confirm a probable age less than 1 Gyr (best range: 500\textendash 900 Myr). We also argue that it is unlikely the cluster is more than 3 kpc away (best range: 2\textendash 3 kpc) if the apparent turnoff, main sequence, and giants are all cluster members.},

The KIC effective temperatures are systematically (110+-1355 K) higher than temperatures we determine from fitting our spectra to PHOENIX stellar models. Through Monte Carlo simulations of the Kepler exoplanet candidate population, we find a planet occurrence of 0.36 {$\pm$} 0.08 when giant stars are properly removed, somewhat higher than when a KIC log g {$>$} 4 criterion is used (0.27 {$\pm$} 0.05). Last, we show that there is no significant difference in g - r color (a probe of metallicity) between late-type Kepler stars with transiting Earth-to-Neptune-size exoplanet candidates and dwarf stars with no detected transits. We show that a previous claimed offset between these two populations is most likely an artifact of including a large number of misidentified giants.},

There are 49 planet candidates around these stars, including 42 detected through transits and 7 revealed by precise Doppler measurements of the host stars. Based on an analysis of the Kepler brightness measurements, along with high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, Doppler spectroscopy, and (for 11 stars) asteroseismology, we establish low false-positive probabilities (FPPs) for all of the transiting planets (41 of 42 have an FPP under 1\%), and we constrain their sizes and masses. Most of the transiting planets are smaller than three times the size of Earth. For 16 planets, the Doppler signal was securely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. For the other 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limits to their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rocky composition. We identify six planets with densities above 5 g cm-3, suggesting a mostly rocky interior for them. Indeed, the only planets that are compatible with a purely rocky composition are smaller than {$\sim$}2 R{$\oplus$}. Larger planets evidently contain a larger fraction of low-density material (H, He, and H2O).},

By using photometry in ultraviolet and optical bands we discovered that the nearby young cluster NGC6705 (M11) exhibits an extended main-sequence turn off (eMSTO) and a broadened main-sequence (MS). This is the first evidence of multiple stellar populations in a Galactic open cluster. By using high-resolution VLT spectra we provide direct evidence that the multiple sequences along the CMD correspond to stellar populations with different rotation rates. Specifically, the blue MS is formed of slow-rotating stars, while red-MS stars are fast rotators. Moreover, we exploit photometry from Gaia DR2 to show that three Galactic open clusters, namely NGC2099, NGC2360, and NGC2818, exhibit the eMSTO, thus suggesting that it is a common feature among these objects. Our previous work on the Large Magellanic Cloud star cluster NGC1818 shows that slowly and fastly-rotating stars populate the blue and red MS observed in its CMD. The similarities between M11 and the young clusters of the Magellanic Clouds suggest that rotation is responsible for the appearance of multiple populations in the CMDs of both Milky Way open clusters and Magellanic Clouds young clusters.},

The data retrieval should work not only across data archives but also across wavelength domains.

Describe the adopted algorithms and results of the pre-computed cross-match of Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) catalogue with dense surveys (Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, SDSS DR9, GSC2.3, URAT1, allWISE, PPMXL, APASS DR9) and sparse catalogues (Hipparcos2, Tycho-2, RAVE 5).

We here establish an empirical relation between these quantities by drawing on 1475 red giants with asteroseismic mass estimates from Kepler that also have spectroscopic labels from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) DR12. We assess the accuracy of our model, and find that it predicts stellar masses with fractional rms errors of about 14 per cent (typically 0.2 M ). From these masses, we derive ages with rms errors of 40 per cent. This empirical model allows us for the first time to make age determinations (in the range 1\textendash 13 Gyr) for vast numbers of giant stars across the Galaxy. We apply our model to {$\sim$}52 000 stars in APOGEE DR12, for which no direct mass and age information was previously available. We find that these estimates highlight the vertical age structure of the Milky Way disc, and that the relation of age with [{$\alpha$}/M] and metallicity is broadly consistent with established expectations based on detailed studies of the solar neighbourhood.},

  abstract = {NGC 6791 is one of the most studied open clusters, it is massive ({$\sim$}5000 M ), located at the solar circle, old ({$\sim$}8 Gyr) and yet the most metal-rich cluster ([Fe/H] 0.4) known in the Milky Way. By performing an orbital analysis within a Galactic model including spiral arms and a bar, we found that it is plausible that NGC 6791 formed in the inner thin disc or in the bulge, and later displaced by radial migration to its current orbit. We apply different tools to simulate NGC 6791, including direct N-body summation in time-varying potentials, to test its survivability when going through different Galactic environments. In order to survive the 8-Gyr journey moving on a migrating orbit, NGC 6791 must have been more massive, M0 {$\geq$} 5 \texttimes{} 104 M , when formed. We find independent confirmation of this initial mass in the stellar mass function, which is observed to be flat; this can only be explained if the average tidal field strength experienced by the cluster is stronger than what it is at its current orbit. Therefore, the birth place and journeys of NGC 6791 are imprinted in its chemical composition, in its mass-loss and in its flat stellar mass function, supporting its origin in the inner thin disc or in the bulge.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method to determine effective temperatures, angular semi-diameters and bolometric corrections for population I and II FGK type stars based on V and 2MASS IR photometry. Accurate calibration is accomplished by using a sample of solar analogues, whose average temperature is assumed to be equal to the solar effective temperature of 5777 K. By taking into account all possible sources of error we estimate associated uncertainties better than 1\% in effective temperature and in the range 1.0-2.5\% in angular semi-diameter for unreddened stars. Comparison of our new temperatures with other determinations extracted from the literature indicates, in general, remarkably good agreement. These results suggest that the effective temperaure scale of FGK stars is currently established with an accuracy better than 0.5\%-1\%. The application of the method to a sample of 10999 dwarfs in the Hipparcos catalogue allows us to define temperature and bolometric correction (K band) calibrations as a function of (V-K), [m/H] and log g. Bolometric corrections in the V and K bands as a function of effective temperature, [m/H] and log g are also given. We provide effective temperatures, angular semi-diameters, radii and bolometric corrections in the V and K bands for the 10999 FGK stars in our sample with the corresponding uncertainties.},

  abstract = {\emph{Context. {$<$}i/{$>$}Stellar spectroscopy provides useful information on the physical properties of stars such as effective temperature, metallicity and surface gravity. However, those photospheric characteristics are often hampered by systematic uncertainties. The joint spectro-sismo project (APOGEE+\emph{Kepler{$<$}i/{$>$}, aka APOKASC) of field red giants has revealed a puzzling offset between the surface gravities (log \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$}) determined spectroscopically and those determined using asteroseismology, which is largely dependent on the stellar evolutionary status. \emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}Therefore, in this letter, we aim to shed light on the spectroscopic source of the offset.\emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}We used the APOKASC sample to analyse the dependencies of the log \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$} discrepancy as a function of stellar mass and stellar evolutionary status. We discuss and study the impact of some neglected abundances on spectral analysis of red giants, such as He and carbon isotopic ratio. \emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}We first show that, for stars at the bottom of the red giant branch where the first dredge-up had occurred, the discrepancy between spectroscopic log \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$} and asteroseismic log \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$} depends on stellar mass. This seems to indicate that the log \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$} discrepancy is related to CN cycling. Among the CN-cycled elements, we demonstrate that the carbon isotopic ratio (\textsuperscript{12{$<$}sup/{$>$}C /\textsuperscript{13{$<$}sup/{$>$}C) has the largest impact on stellar spectrum. In parallel, we observe that this log \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$} discrepancy shows a similar trend as the \textsuperscript{12{$<$}sup/{$>$}C /\textsuperscript{13{$<$}sup/{$>$}C ratios as expected by stellar evolution theory. Although we did not detect a direct spectroscopic signature of \textsuperscript{13{$<$}sup/{$>$}C, other corroborating evidences suggest that the discrepancy in log \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$} is tightly correlated to the production of \textsuperscript{13{$<$}sup/{$>$}C in red giants. Moreover, by running the data-driven algorithm (the Cannon) on a synthetic grid trained on the APOGEE data, we try to evaluate more quantitatively the impact of various \textsuperscript{12{$<$}sup/{$>$}C /\textsuperscript{13{$<$}sup/{$>$}C ratios. \emph{Conclusions. {$<$}i/{$>$}While we have demonstrated that \textsuperscript{13{$<$}sup/{$>$}C indeed impacts all parameters, the size of the impact is smaller than the observed offset in log \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$}. If further tests confirm that \textsuperscript{13{$<$}sup/{$>$}C is not the main element responsible of the log \emph{g{$<$}i/{$>$} problem, the number of spectroscopic effects remaining to be investigated is now relatively limited (if any).}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {Scientific Objectives: Asteroseismology has proved to be a very powerful tool thanks to the high-precision data obtained by the space missions such as Kepler and CoRoT. Solar-like oscillations have been detected and reported for around 15,600 red giants and 540 main-sequence stars observed by the nominal Kepler mission. Hence, these stars have their surface gravities, masses, and radii obtained with seismology. However, according to the latest Kepler star properties catalog (Mathur et al., in prep.) more than 24,000 red giants, 127,000 FGK dwarfs, and 10,000 subgiants were targeted. K2 has been observing 90,000 red giants and dwarfs. Moreover, the continuous photometric data of 4 yrs (resp. 3 mo) collected by Kepler (resp. K2) contain the signature of other phenomena such as convection, rotation, and magnetism, which are very important to understand stellar evolution and can also be used to obtain precise fundamental stellar parameters even when pulsations are not detected. We propose to perform the largest homogeneous analysis to date of seismic oscillations, convection, and rotation/magnetic activity across the full range of stellar spectral types and evolutionary states present in the K2 and Kepler missions. We will use the longest publicly available time series to derive the most accurate surface gravities, rotation periods, evolutionary states, and magnetic activity levels to characterize rotation-age-magnetic activity relationships and oscillations-magnetism interaction. Relevance: The determination of the gravity, mass, radius, and age of planet host stars allow us to better characterize the planetary systems. By studying the stellar surface rotation periods, we can better understand the angular momentum transport involved during the stellar evolution and have more accurate rotation-age relationships. Finally, the study of the magnetic activity of a large number of stars will allow us to put the Sun in a broader context. This work will also have an impact on galactic evolution study. Methodology: We will analyse the data with the new version of the A2Z pipeline (Mathur et al. 2010) on the stars where no acoustic modes have been detected or completely characterized so far. In the case that still no modes are observed, we will study the convective background as it has been shown that the granulation timescale is proportional to the surface gravity of the star (Mathur et al. 2011). We will develop and automate the recent method developed by Kallinger et al. (2016) that proved it is possible to measure logg very precisely with the auto-correlation function for stars where the modes are slightly above the Nyquist frequency, i.e. subgiants for the long cadence data. We will analyze dwarfs and subgiants observed by Kepler and K2 to look for their rotation periods following Garcia et al. (2014). This method was shown to have the best combination of completeness and reliability according to hare and hounds benchmarks (Aigrain et al., 2015). We will calibrate gyrochronology relation with the best-characterized dwarfs as done by van Saders et al. (2016) and apply it to dwarfs when applicable to estimate their ages. For the stars where a reliable rotation period is determined we will compute a photometric magnetic proxy as defined in Mathur et al. (2014). In many cases we will have complementary spectroscopic observations (e.g. Gaia). Data: We will analyse the Kepler Q0-Q17 data calibrated with the KADACS software (Garcia et al. 2011; Mathur et al. in prep.) and the K2 C1 to C7 data processed by Vanderburg \&amp; Johnson (2014).},

  abstract = {Asteroseismology has proven to be an excellent tool to determine not only global stellar properties with good precision, but also to infer the stellar structure, dynamics, and evolution for a large sample of Kepler stars. Prior to the launch of the mission, the properties of Kepler targets were inferred from broadband photometry, leading to the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). The KIC was later revised in the Kepler Star Properties Catalog, based on literature values and an asteroseismic analysis of stars that were unclassified in the KIC. Here, we present an asteroseismic analysis of 45,400 stars that were classified as dwarfs in the Kepler Star Properties Catalog. We found that around 2\% of the sample shows acoustic modes in the typical frequency range that put them in the red-giant category rather than the cool dwarf category. We analyze the asteroseismic properties of these stars, derive their surface gravities, masses, and radii, and present updated effective temperatures and distances. We show that the sample is significantly fainter than the previously known oscillating giants in the Kepler field, with the faintest stars reaching down to a Kepler magnitude of Kp {$\sim$} 16. We demonstrate that 404 stars are at distances beyond 5 kpc and that the stars are significantly less massive than for the original Kepler red-giant sample, consistent with a population of distant halo giants. A comparison with a galactic population model shows that up to 40 stars might be genuine halo giants, which would increase the number of known asteroseismic halo stars by a factor of 4. The detections presented here will provide a valuable sample for galactic archeology studies.},

We present revised stellar properties for 197,096 Kepler targets observed between Quarters 1\textendash 17 (Q1-17), which were used for the final transiting planet search run by the Kepler Mission (Data Release 25, DR25). Similar to the Q1\textendash 16 catalog by Huber et al., the classifications are based on conditioning published atmospheric parameters on a grid of Dartmouth isochrones, with significant improvements in the adopted method and over 29,000 new sources for temperatures, surface gravities, or metallicities. In addition to fundamental stellar properties, the new catalog also includes distances and extinctions, and we provide posterior samples for each stellar parameter of each star. Typical uncertainties are {$\sim$}27\% in radius, {$\sim$}17\% in mass, and {$\sim$}51\% in density, which is somewhat smaller than previous catalogs because of the larger number of improved log g constraints and the inclusion of isochrone weighting when deriving stellar posterior distributions. On average, the catalog includes a significantly larger number of evolved solar-type stars, with an increase of 43.5\% in the number of subgiants. We discuss the overall changes of radii and masses of Kepler targets as a function of spectral type, with a particular focus on exoplanet host stars.},

  abstract = {We analyze the photometric short-cadence data obtained with the Kepler mission during the first 8 months of observations of two solar-type stars of spectral types G and F: KIC 11395018 and KIC 11234888, respectively, the latter having a lower signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) compared with the former. We estimate global parameters of the acoustic (p) modes such as the average large and small frequency separations, the frequency of the maximum of the p-mode envelope, and the average line width of the acoustic modes. We were able to identify and to measure 22 p-mode frequencies for the first star and 16 for the second one even though the S/N of these stars are rather low. We also derive some information about the stellar rotation periods from the analyses of the low-frequency parts of the power spectral densities. A model-independent estimation of the mean density, mass, and radius is obtained using the scaling laws. We emphasize the importance of continued observations for the stars with low S/N for an improved characterization of the oscillation modes. Our results offer a preview of what will be possible for many stars with the long data sets obtained during the remainder of the mission.},

  abstract = {Asteroseismology with the Kepler space telescope is providing not only an improved characterization of exoplanets and their host stars, but also a new window on stellar structure and evolution for the large sample of solar-type stars in the field. We perform a uniform analysis of 22 of the brightest asteroseismic targets with the highest signalto-noise ratio observed for 1 month each during the first year of the mission, and we quantify the precision and relative accuracy of asteroseismic determinations of the stellar radius, mass, and age that are possible using various methods. We present the properties of each star in the sample derived from an automated analysis of the individual oscillation frequencies and other observational constraints using the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal (AMP), and we compare them to the results of model-grid-based methods that fit the global oscillation properties. We find that fitting the individual frequencies typically yields asteroseismic radii and masses to {$\sim$}1\% precision, and ages to {$\sim$}2.5\% precision (respectively, 2, 5, and 8 times better than fitting the global oscillation properties). The absolute level of agreement between the results from different approaches is also encouraging, with model-grid-based methods yielding slightly smaller estimates of the radius and mass and slightly older values for the stellar age relative to AMP, which computes a large number of dedicated models for each star. The sample of targets for which this type of analysis is possible will grow as longer data sets are obtained during the remainder of the mission.},

Four independent groups of researchers utilized the oscillation frequencies themselves, the second differences of the frequencies and the ratio of the small and large separation to locate the base of the convection zone and the second helium ionization zone.

We find a local total surface density of M dwarfs of 17.3+/- 2.3 \{M\}{$\odot$} \{\{pc\}\}-2, whcih is significantly higher than previous values. Our result for the total local surface density of visible stars (main-sequence stars and giants), 27.0+/- 2.7 \{M\}{$\odot$} \{\{pc\}\}-2, is close to previous estimates due to a cancellation of opposing effects: more mass in M dwarfs, less mass in the others. The total local surface density in white dwarfs is 4.9+/- 0.6 \{M\}{$\odot$} \{\{pc\}\}-2; in brown dwarfs, it is {$\sim$} 1.2 \{M\}{$\odot$} \{\{pc\}\}-2, but with considerable uncertainty. We find that the total local surface density of stars and stellar remnants is 33.4+/- 3 \{M\}{$\odot$}  \{\{pc\}\}-2, which is somewhat less than previous estimates but within the errors of many of them. We analyze data on 21 cm emission and absorption and obtain good agreement with recent results on the local amount of neutral atomic hydrogen obtained with the Planck satellite.

Major issues discussed in this book include identifiability problems, actual fitting of finite mixtures through use of the EM algorithm, properties of the maximum likelihood estimators so obtained, assessment of the number of components to be used in the mixture, and the applicability of asymptotic theory in providing a basis for the solutions to some of these problems. The author also considers how the EM algorithm can be scaled to handle the fitting of mixture models to very large databases, as in data mining applications. This comprehensive, practical guide: * Provides more than 800 references-40\% published since 1995 * Includes an appendix listing available mixture software * Links statistical literature with machine learning and pattern recognition literature * Contains more than 100 helpful graphs, charts, and tables Finite Mixture Models is an important resource for both applied and theoretical statisticians as well as for researchers in the many areas in which finite mixture models can be used to analyze data.},

We find that the fraction of stars with variability greater than that of the Sun is 60\%, which is marginally consistent with previous studies, and confirm the trend of increasing variability with decreasing effective temperatures. We define low and high variability samples, with a cut corresponding to twice the variability level of the active Sun, and compare the properties of the stars belonging to each sample. We show tentative evidence that the more active stars have lower proper motions and may be located closer to the galactic plane. We also investigate the frequency content of the variability, finding clear evidence for periodic or quasi-periodic behaviour in 16\% of stars, and showing that there exist significant differences in the nature of variability between spectral types. Of the periodic objects, most A and F stars have short periods ({$<$}2 days) and highly sinusoidal variability, suggestive of pulsations, whilst G, K and M stars tend to have longer periods ({$>$}5 days, with a trend towards longer periods at later spectral types) and show a mixture of periodic and stochastic variability, indicative of activity. Finally, we use auto-regressive models to characterise the stochastic component of the variability, and show that its typical amplitude and time-scale both increase towards later spectral types, which we interpret as a corresponding increase in the characteristic size and life-time of active regions.},

This result extends to 1 Gyr similar prior results in the {$\sim$}600 Myr Hyades and Praesepe clusters, suggesting that rotation periods for cool dwarf stars delineate a well-defined surface in the three-dimensional space of color (mass), rotation, and age.

Over 95 per cent of such clusters have stellar densities too low (less than a hundred stars per cubic parsec) to withstand internal and external dynamical stresses and fall apart within a few hundred million years. Older open clusters have survived by virtue of being richer and denser in stars (1,000 to 10,000 per cubic parsec) when they formed. Such clusters represent a stellar environment very different from the birthplace of the Sun and other planet-hosting field stars. So far more than 800 planets have been found around Sun-like stars in the field. The field planets are usually the size of Neptune or smaller. In contrast, only four planets have been found orbiting stars in open clusters, all with masses similar to or greater than that of Jupiter. Here we report observations of the transits of two Sun-like stars by planets smaller than Neptune in the billion-year-old open cluster NGC6811. This demonstrates that small planets can form and survive in a dense cluster environment, and implies that the frequency and properties of planets in open clusters are consistent with those of planets around field stars in the Galaxy.},

Here we investigate the composition of turn-off stars in the intriguing open cluster, NGC 6791, which is old, but super-metal-rich with high-resolution (R = 46,000) Keck/HIRES spectra. We find [Fe/H] = +0.30 {$\pm$} 0.02 from measurements of some 40 unblended, unsaturated lines of both Fe i and Fe ii in eight turn-off stars. Our O abundances come from the O i triplet near 7774 \AA{} and we perform a differential analysis relative to the Sun from our Lunar spectrum also obtained with Keck/HIRES. The O results are corrected for small nLTE effects. We find consistent ratios of [O/Fe]n with a mean of -0.06 {$\pm$} 0.02. This is low with respect to field stars that are also both old and metal-rich and continue the trend of decreasing [O/Fe] with increasing [Fe/H]. The small range in our oxygen abundances is consistent with a single population of stars. Our results for the alpha elements [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], and [Ti/Fe] are near solar and compare well with those of the old, metal-rich field stars. The two Fe-peak elements, Cr and Ni, are consistent with Fe. These turn-off-star abundances provide benchmark abundances to investigate whether there are any observable abundance differences with the giants that might arise from nuclear-burning and dredge-up processes. Determinations of upper limits were found for Li by spectrum synthesis and are consistent with the upper limits in similar stars in the relatively old, super-metal-rich cluster NGC 6253. Our results support the prediction from standard theory that higher-metallicity stars deplete more Li. Probably no stars in NGC 6791 have retained their initial Li.},

An analysis with the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal, using all of the available constraints to model each star independently, yields the same age (t = 7.0 {$\pm$} 0.3 Gyr) and composition (Z = 0.021 {$\pm$} 0.002, Yi = 0.25 {$\pm$} 0.01) for both stars, as expected for a binary system. We quantify the accuracy of the derived stellar properties by conducting a similar analysis of a Kepler-like data set for the Sun, and we investigate how the reliability of asteroseismic inference changes when fewer observational constraints are available or when different fitting methods are employed. We find that our estimates of the initial helium mass fraction are probably biased low by 0.02\textendash 0.03 from neglecting diffusion and settling of heavy elements, and we identify changes to our fitting method as the likely source of small shifts from our initial results in 2012. We conclude that in the best cases reliable stellar properties can be determined from asteroseismic analysis even without independent constraints on the radius and luminosity.},

  abstract = {The evolved solar-type stars 16 Cyg A and B have long been studied as solar analogs, yielding a glimpse into the future of our own Sun. The orbital period of the binary system is too long to provide meaningful dynamical constraints on the stellar properties, but asteroseismology can help because the stars are among the brightest in the Kepler field. We present an analysis of three months of nearly uninterrupted photometry of 16 Cyg A and B from the Kepler space telescope. We extract a total of 46 and 41 oscillation frequencies for the two components, respectively, including a clear detection of octupole (l = 3) modes in both stars. We derive the properties of each star independently using the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal, fitting the individual oscillation frequencies and other observational constraints simultaneously. We evaluate the systematic uncertainties from an ensemble of results generated by a variety of stellar evolution codes and fitting methods. The optimal models derived by fitting each component individually yield a common age (t = 6.8 {$\pm$} 0.4 Gyr) and initial composition (Zi = 0.024 {$\pm$} 0.002, Yi = 0.25 {$\pm$} 0.01) within the uncertainties, as expected for the components of a binary system, bolstering our confidence in the reliability of asteroseismic techniques. The longer data sets that will ultimately become available will allow future studies of differential rotation, convection zone depths, and long-term changes due to stellar activity cycles.},

  abstract = {After decades of effort, the solar activity cycle is exceptionally well characterized, but it remains poorly understood. Pioneering work at the Mount Wilson Observatory demonstrated that other Sun-like stars also show regular activity cycles, and suggested two possible relationships between the rotation rate and the length of the cycle. Neither of these relationships correctly describes the properties of the Sun, a peculiarity that demands explanation. Recent discoveries have started to shed light on this issue, suggesting that the Sun's rotation rate and magnetic field are currently in a transitional phase that occurs in all middle-aged stars. Motivated by these developments, we identify the manifestation of this magnetic transition in the best available data on stellar cycles. We propose a reinterpretation of previously published observations to suggest that the solar cycle may be growing longer on stellar evolutionary timescales, and that the cycle might disappear sometime in the next 0.8 \textendash{} 2.4 Gyr. Future tests of this hypothesis will come from ground-based activity monitoring of Kepler targets that span the magnetic transition, and from asteroseismology with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission to determine precise masses and ages for bright stars with known cycles.},

The asteroseismic capabilities of the mission are being used to determine precise radii and ages for the target stars from their solar-like oscillations. Chaplin et al. published observations of three bright G-type stars, which were monitored during the first 33.5 days of science operations. One of these stars, the subgiant KIC 11026764, exhibits a characteristic pattern of oscillation frequencies suggesting that it has evolved significantly. We have derived asteroseismic estimates of the properties of KIC 11026764 from Kepler photometry combined with ground-based spectroscopic data. We present the results of detailed modeling for this star, employing a variety of independent codes and analyses that attempt to match the asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints simultaneously. We determine both the radius and the age of KIC 11026764 with a precision near 1\%, and an accuracy near 2\% for the radius and 15\% for the age. Continued observations of this star promise to reveal additional oscillation frequencies that will further improve the determination of its fundamental properties.},

While only a few such data sets were available for detailed modeling just a decade ago, the Kepler mission has produced suitable observations for hundreds of new targets. This rapid expansion in observational capacity has been accompanied by a shift in analysis and modeling strategies to yield uniform sets of derived stellar properties more quickly and easily. We use previously published asteroseismic and spectroscopic data sets to provide a uniform analysis of 42 solar-type Kepler targets from the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal. We find that fitting the individual frequencies typically doubles the precision of the asteroseismic radius, mass, and age compared to grid-based modeling of the global oscillation properties, and improves the precision of the radius and mass by about a factor of three over empirical scaling relations. We demonstrate the utility of the derived properties with several applications.},

These critical data have recently provided the first opportunity to calibrate rotation\textendash age relations for stars older than the Sun. The evolutionary picture that emerges is surprising: beyond middle-age the efficiency of magnetic braking is dramatically reduced, implying a fundamental change in angular momentum loss beyond a critical Rossby number (Ro {$\sim$} 2). We compile published chromospheric activity measurements for the sample of Kepler asteroseismic targets that were used to establish the new rotation\textendash age relations. We use these data along with a sample of wellcharacterized solar analogs from the Mount Wilson HK survey to develop a qualitative scenario connecting the evolution of chromospheric activity to a fundamental shift in the character of differential rotation. We conclude that the Sun may be in a transitional evolutionary phase, and that its magnetic cycle might represent a special case of stellar dynamo theory.},

  abstract = {Nearly half a century has passed since the initial indications that stellar rotation slows while chromospheric activity weakens with a power-law dependence on age, the so-called Skumanich relations. Subsequent characterization of the mass-dependence of this behavior up to the age of the Sun led to the advent of gyrochronology, which uses the rotation rate of a star to infer its age from an empirical calibration. The efficacy of the method relies on predictable angular momentum loss from a stellar wind entrained in the large-scale magnetic field produced by global dynamo action. Recent observational evidence suggests that the global dynamo begins to shut down near the middle of a star's main-sequence lifetime, leading to a disruption in the production of large-scale magnetic field, a dramatic reduction in angular momentum loss, and a breakdown of gyrochronology relations. For solar-type stars this transition appears to occur near the age of the Sun, when rotation becomes too slow to imprint Coriolis forces on the global convective patterns, reducing the shear induced by differential rotation, and disrupting the large-scale dynamo. We use data from Barnes to reveal the signature of this transition in the observations that were originally used to validate gyrochronology. We propose that chromospheric activity may ultimately provide a more reliable age indicator for older stars, and we suggest that asteroseismology can be used to help calibrate activity-age relations for field stars beyond the middle of their main-sequence lifetimes.},

The clusters collected here constitute an ensemble of homogeneous and accurate data, well discussed for distance, reddening, membership and binarity, and thus they provide a basic reference for age determinations. The present set of isochrones fits the observed color-magnitude diagrams of the clusters very accurately, and may thus be expected to provide reliable ages. Analytic relations between several characteristics of the isochrones and the age are given and can be used for further age calibrations consistent with this homogeneous scale.},

COROT is addressing the problem of the understanding and treatment of the convection and angular momentum transfer and, more generally, of transport mechanisms identified as a preponderant source of uncertainty in our present modelling of stellar evolution. COROT will be launch by 2002 on a quasi-polar orbit. In the frame of its central program, COROT will observe 5 fields with stars representative of different masses, evolution stages and rotation rates on the main sequence, between 1 and 2.5 Modot approximately. Each of these fields will be tracked during 5 months continuously. The main purpose of this central program is to obtain a high precision on eigenfrequencies measurement (0.1 muHz for stars with mV {$<$} 6), allowing to go beyond the first order asymptotic description of the spectra. As we show here, this precision will allow COROT to probe the structure of stars with the precision required to adress the problem of the transport mechanisms. Besides this central program, COROT's "exploratory program" will provide a survey of "solar-like" variability at 1ppm for a sample of 50 to 80 stars on the Main Sequence with mV {$<$} 9. A secondary program is dedicated to the search of telluric exoplanets. It will track about 60000 stars down to magnitude 15th continuously during 150 days also, with a 15 minutes sampling time and a 10-4 photometric accuracy. A broad scientific return in terms of stellar physics is also expected from this program.},

This novel method relies on the detection of the presence of two solar-like oscillation spectra in the frequency spectrum of a single light curve. Here, we make predictions of the numbers of systems that may be detectable in data already collected by the NASA Kepler Mission. Our predictions, which are based upon TRILEGAL and BiSEPS simulations of the Kepler field of view, indicate that as many as 200 or more ``asteroseismic binaries'' may be detectable in this manner. Most of these binaries should be comprised of two He-core-burning red giants. Owing largely to the limited numbers of targets with the requisite short-cadence Kepler data, we expect only a small number of detected binaries containing solar-type stars. The predicted yield of detections is sensitive to the assumed initial mass ratio distribution (IMRD) of the binary components and therefore represents a sensitive calibration of the much debated IMRD near mass ratio unity.},

For the MS stars we find [Fe/H] = \$+\$0.05 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.04 and [Ba/Fe] = \$-\$0.01 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 0.10. The majority of the BS stars are consistent with these values. We identify five BSs with significant barium enhancement. These stars most likely formed through mass transfer from an asymptotic giant branch star that polluted the surface of the BS with the nucleosynthesis products generated during thermal pulsations. This conclusion aligns with the results from the substantial work done on the BSs in old open cluster NGC 188 that identifies mass transfer as the dominant mechanism for BS formation in that open cluster. However, four of the BSs with enhanced barium show no radial-velocity evidence for a companion. The one star that is in a binary is a double-lined system, meaning the companion is not a white dwarf and not the remnant of a prior AGB star. In this paper we attempt to develop a consistent scenario to explain the origin of these five BSs.},

Formation theories for BSs include mergers in hierarchical triple systems, collisions during dynamical encounters, and mass transfer from an evolved companion. Such mass transfer events can pollute the surface abundance of the BS with the nucleosynthesis products from the evolved donor. Specifically, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) mass transfer should enhance the surface abundances of s-process elements, like barium, created during the thermally-pulsing phase of AGB evolution. The products of mergers and collisions would have no such enhancements. This makes barium an excellent marker for a mass-transfer formation history with an AGB-donor. In this thesis I start with the radial velocity (RV) surveys of the open clusters NGC 6819 and NGC 7789. I then introduce my discovery of five barium enriched BSs in NGC 6819, four of which have no RV evidence of a companion. Next, I triple the number of confirmed open cluster SSGs through my discovery of four such systems in NGC 6791 and present robust orbital solutions for three of them. And finally I discuss the implications of my work in context with the extensively studied open clusters M67 and NGC 188.},

These results are the product of our ongoing RV survey of NGC 6819 using the Hydra Multi-Object Spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope. We also include a detailed analysis of multiple prior sets of optical photometry for NGC 6819. Within a 1\textdegree{} field of view, our stellar sample includes the giant branch, the red clump, and blue straggler candidates, and extends to almost 2 mag below the main sequence (MS) turnoff. For each star observed in our survey we present all RV measurements, the average RV, and velocity variability information. Additionally, we discuss notable binaries from our sample, including eclipsing binaries (WOCS 23009, WOCS 24009, and WOCS 40007), stars noted in Kepler asteroseismology studies (WOCS 4008, WOCS 7009, and WOCS 8007), and potential descendants of past blue stragglers (WOCS 1006 and WOCS 6002). We find the incompleteness-corrected binary fraction for all MS binaries with periods less than 10\textsuperscript{4} days to be 22\% {$\pm$} 3\% and a tidal circularization period of 6.2\^\{+1.1\}\_\{-1.1\} days for NGC 6819.},

We also identify three member SSGs as short-period binary systems and present their orbital solutions. These are the first SSGs with known three-dimensional kinematic membership, binary status, and orbital parameters since the two SSGs in M67 studied by Mathieu et al. We also remark on the other properties of these stars including photometric variability, H {$\alpha$} emission, and X-ray luminosity. The membership confirmation of these SSGs in NGC 6791 strengthens the case that SSGs are a new class of nonstandard stellar evolution products, and that a physical mechanism must be found that explains the evolutionary paths of these stars.},

  abstract = {Context. Currently galactic exploration is being revolutionized by a flow of new data: Gaia provides measurements of stellar distances and kinematics; growing numbers of spectroscopic surveys provide values of stellar atmospheric parameters and abundances of elements; and Kepler and K2 missions provide asteroseismic information for an increasing number of stars. Aims. In this work we aim to determine stellar distances and ages using Gaia and spectrophotometric data in a consistent way. We estimate precisions of age and distance determinations with Gaia end-of-mission and TGAS parallax precisions. Methods. To this end we incorporated parallax and extinction data into the isochrone fitting method used in the Unified tool to estimate Distances, Ages, and Masses (UniDAM). We prepared datasets that allowed us to study the improvement of distance and age estimates with the inclusion of TGAS and Gaia end-of-mission parallax precisions in isochrone fitting. Results. Using TGAS parallaxes in isochrone fitting we are able to reduce distance and age estimate uncertainties for TGAS stars for distances up to 1 kpc by more than one third, compared to results based only on spectrophotometric data. With Gaia end-of-mission parallaxes in isochrone fitting we will be able to further decrease our distance uncertainties by about a factor of 20 and age uncertainties by a factor of two for stars up to 10 kpc away from the Sun. Conclusions. We demonstrate that we will be able to improve our distance estimates for about one third of stars in spectroscopic surveys and to decrease log(age) uncertainties by about a factor of two for over 80\% of stars as compared to the uncertainties obtained without parallax priors using Gaia end-of-mission parallaxes consistently with spectrophotometry in isochrone fitting .},

After combining the samples from the various surveys and correcting for their respective selection effects, we find that the properties of companions to O-type and B-type main-sequence (MS) stars differ among three regimes. First, at short orbital periods P {$\lessequivlnt$} 20 days (separations a {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.4 au), the binaries have small eccentricities e {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.4, favor modest mass ratios , and exhibit a small excess of twins q {$>$} 0.95. Second, the companion frequency peaks at intermediate periods log P (days) {$\approx$} 3.5 (a {$\approx$} 10 au), where the binaries have mass ratios weighted toward small values q {$\approx$} 0.2\textendash 0.3 and follow a Maxwellian ``thermal'' eccentricity distribution. Finally, companions with long orbital periods log P (days) {$\approx$} 5.5\textendash 7.5 (a {$\approx$} 200\textendash 5000 au) are outer tertiary components in hierarchical triples and have a mass ratio distribution across q {$\approx$} 0.1\textendash 1.0 that is nearly consistent with random pairings drawn from the initial mass function. We discuss these companion distributions and properties in the context of binary-star formation and evolution. We also reanalyze the binary statistics of solar-type MS primaries, taking into account that 30\% {$\pm$} 10\% of single-lined spectroscopic binaries likely contain white dwarf companions instead of low-mass stellar secondaries. The mean frequency of stellar companions with q {$>$} 0.1 and log P (days) {$<$} 8.0 per primary increases from 0.50 {$\pm$} 0.04 for solar-type MS primaries to 2.1 {$\pm$} 0.3 for O-type MS primaries.

We use two different spectroscopic methods to analyse 189 high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise spectra acquired for the 169 stars. For 67 stars, the spectroscopic atmospheric parameters are derived for the first time. KIC 9693187 and 11179629 are discovered to be double-lined spectroscopic binary systems. The results obtained for those stars for which independent determinations of the atmospheric parameters are available in the literature are used for a comparative analysis. As a result, we show that for solar-type stars the accuracy of present determinations of atmospheric parameters is {$\pm$}150 K in Teff, {$\pm$}0.15 dex in [Fe/H] and {$\pm$}0.3 dex in log g. Finally, we confirm that the curve-of-growth analysis and the method of spectral synthesis yield systematically different atmospheric parameters when they are applied to stars hotter than 6000 K.},

Finally, we show that the early-type star HIP 94472 is rotating slowly (v sin i = 13 km s-1) and we confirm its classification to the Am spectral type which makes it an interesting and promising target for asteroseismic modelling. The comparison of the results reported in this paper with the information in the Kepler Input Catalogue (KIC) shows an urgent need for verification and refinement of the atmospheric parameters listed in the KIC. That refinement is crucial for making a full use of the data delivered by Kepler and can be achieved only by a detailed ground-based study.},

The Kepler-data include observations of stars in open clusters, which are particularly interesting for asteroseismology. One of the clusters observed with Kepler is NGC 6811, which is the target of this paper. However, apart from high-precision time series observations, sounding the interiors of stars in open clusters by means of asteroseismology also requires accurate and precise atmospheric parameters as well as cluster membership indicators for the individual stars. We use medium-resolution (R {$\sim$} 25 000) spectroscopic observations, and three independent analysis methods, to derive effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, projected rotational velocities and radial velocities, for 15 stars in the field of the open cluster NGC 6811. We discover two double-lined and three single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Eight stars are classified as either certain or very probable cluster members, and three stars are classified as non-members. For four stars, cluster membership could not been assessed. Five of the observed stars are G-type giants which are located in the colour-magnitude diagram in the region of the red clump of the cluster. Two of these stars are surely identified as red clump stars for the first time. For those five stars, we provide chemical abundances of 31 elements. The mean radial velocity of NGC 6811 is found to be +6.68 {$\pm$} 0.08 km s-1 and the mean metallicity and overall abundance pattern are shown to be very close to solar with an exception of Ba which we find to be overabundant.},

The method takes binary fraction into account and uses a Monte-Carlo approach to obtain uncertainties on the determined parameters for the cluster by running the fitting algorithm many times with a re-sampled data set through a bootstrapping procedure. We present results for 9 well studied open clusters, based on 15 distinct data sets, and show that the results are consistent with previous studies. The method is shown to be reliable and free of the subjectivity of most previous visual isochrone fitting techniques.},

We obtain accurate relative photometry of KIC 8462852 from the Kepler full-frame images, finding that the brightness of KIC 8462852 monotonically decreased over the four years it was observed by Kepler. Over the first {$\sim$}1000 days KIC 8462852 faded approximately linearly at a rate of 0.341{$\pm$}0.041\% yr-1, for a total decline of 0.9\%. KIC 8462852 then dimmed much more rapidly in the next {$\sim$}200 days, with its flux dropping by more than 2\%. For the final {$\sim$}200 days of Kepler photometry the magnitude remained approximately constant, although the data are also consistent with the decline rate measured for the first 2.7 years. Of a sample of 193 nearby comparison stars and 355 stars with similar stellar parameters, none exhibit the rapid decline by {$>$}2\% or the cumulative fading by 3\% of KIC 8462852. Moreover, of these comparison stars, only one changes brightness as quickly as the 0.341\% yr-1 measured for KIC 8462852 during the first three years of the Kepler mission. We examine whether the rapid decline could be caused by a cloud of transiting circumstellar material, finding that while such a cloud could evade detection in submillimeter observations, the transit ingress and duration cannot be explained by a simple cloud model. Moreover, this model cannot account for the observed longer-term dimming. No known or proposed stellar phenomena can fully explain all aspects of the observed light curve.},

This long-term variability can be recovered in photometry from the full-frame images (FFIs), a set of calibration data collected approximately monthly during the Kepler mission. Here we present f3, an open-source package to perform photometry on the Kepler FFIs in order to detect changes in the brightness of stars in the Kepler field of view over long time baselines. We apply this package to a sample of 4000 Sun\textendash like stars with measured rotation periods. We find that {$\approx$}10\% of these targets have long-term variability in their observed flux. For the majority of targets, we find that the luminosity variations are either correlated or anticorrelated with the short-term variability due to starspots on the stellar surface. We find a transition between anticorrelated (starspotdominated) variability and correlated (facula-dominated) variability between rotation periods of 15 and 25 days, suggesting the transition between the two modes is complete for stars at the age of the Sun. We also identify a sample of stars with apparently complete cycles, as well as a collection of short-period binaries with extreme photometric variation over the Kepler mission.},

  abstract = {The abundance of short-period planetary systems with high orbital obliquities relative to the spin of their host stars is often taken as evidence that scattering processes play important roles in the formation and evolution of these systems. More recent studies have suggested that wide binary companions can tilt protoplanetary disks, inducing a high stellar obliquity that form through smooth processes like disk migration. DS Tuc Ab, a transiting planet with an 8.138 day period in the 40 Myr Tucana-Horologium association, likely orbits in the same plane as its now-dissipated protoplanetary disk, enabling us to test these theories of disk physics. Here, we report on Rossiter-McLaughlin observations of one transit of DS Tuc Ab with the Planet Finder Spectrograph on the Magellan Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We confirm the previously detected planet by modeling the planet transit and stellar activity signals simultaneously. We test multiple models to describe the stellar activity-induced radial velocity variations over the night of the transit, finding the obliquity to be low: \$\textbackslash lambda = 12 \textbackslash pm 13\$ degrees, suggesting that this planet likely formed through smooth disk processes and its protoplanetary disk was not significantly torqued by DS Tuc B. The specific stellar activity model chosen affects the results at the \$\textbackslash approx 5\$ degree level. This is the youngest planet to be observed using this technique; we provide a discussion on best practices to accurately measure the observed signal of similar young planets.},

With this reddening the UBV 2-color diagram for the cluster does not match the standard solar-metallicity 2-color diagram. The substantial Ultra Violet (UV) deficiency requires the cluster to be metal rich. Regardless of the choice of reddening value, if we make the assumption of solar metallicity for the cluster we cannot simultaneously derive a consistent fit of the 2-color diagram to standard 2-color sequences and the color-magnitude diagram to published isochrones.

We pursued forward seismic modelling based on adiabatic eigenfrequencies of equilibrium models for eight extensive evolutionary grids tuned to KIC 10526294 by varying the initial mass, metallicity, chemical mixture, and the extent of the overshooting layer on top of the convective core. We examined models for both OP and OPAL opacities and tested the occurrence of extra diffusive mixing throughout the radiative interior. Results. We find a tight mass-metallicity relation within the ranges M {$\in$} [3.13, 3.25] M and Z {$\in$} [0.014, 0.028]. We deduce that an exponentially decaying diffusive core overshooting prescription describes the seismic data better than a step function formulation and derive a value of fov between 0.017 and 0.018. Moreover, the inclusion of extra diffusive mixing with a value of log Dmix between 1.75 and 2.00 dex (with Dmix in cm2 s-1) improves the goodness-of-fit based on the observed and modelled frequencies by a factor {$\sim$}11 compared to the case where no extra mixing is considered, irrespective of the (M, Z) combination within the allowed seismic range. Conclusions. The inclusion of diffusive mixing in addition to core overshooting is essential to explain the structure in the observed period spacing pattern of this star. Moreover, for the input physics and chemical mixtures we investigated, we deduce that an exponentially decaying prescription for the core overshooting is to be preferred over a step function, regardless of the adopted mixture or choice of opacity tables. Our best models for KIC 10526294 approach the seismic data to a level that they can serve future inversion of its stellar structure.},

We use series of radial-mode frequencies in published analyses of stars with solarlike oscillations to compare the asymptotic and observational values of the large separation. This comparison relies on the proper use of the second-order asymptotic expansion. Results. We propose a simple formulation to correct the observed value of the large separation and then derive its asymptotic counterpart. The measurement of the curvature of the radial ridges in the \'echelle diagram provides the correcting factor. We prove that, apart from glitches due to stellar structure discontinuities, the asymptotic expansion is valid from main-sequence stars to red giants. Our model shows that the asymptotic offset is close to 1/4, as in the theoretical development, for low-mass, main-sequence stars, subgiants and red giants. Conclusions. High-quality solar-like oscillation spectra derived from precise photometric measurements are definitely better described with the second-order asymptotic expansion. The second-order term is responsible for the curvature observed in the \'echelle diagrams used for analyzing the oscillation spectra, and this curvature is responsible for the difference between the observed and asymptotic values of the large separation. Taking it into account yields a revision of the scaling relations, which provides more accurate asteroseismic estimates of the stellar mass and radius. After correction of the bias (6\% for the stellar radius and 3\% for the mass), the performance of the calibrated relation is about 4\% and 8\% for estimating, respectively, the stellar radius and the stellar mass for masses less than 1.3 M ; the accuracy is twice as bad for higher mass stars and red giants.},

  abstract = {Methods. Various different methods were compared in order to validate the processes and to derive reliable output values. For consistency, a single method was then used to determine scaling relations for the relevant global asteroseismic parameters: mean mode height, mean height of the background signal superimposed on the oscillation power excess, width of the power excess, bolometric amplitude of the radial modes and visibility of non-radial modes. A method for deriving oscillation amplitudes is proposed, which relies on the complete identification of the red giant oscillation spectrum. Results. The comparison of the different methods has shown the important role of the way the background is modelled. The convergence reached by the collaborative work enables us to derive significant results concerning the oscillation power excess. We obtain several scaling relations, and identify the influence of the stellar mass and the evolutionary status. The effect of helium burning on the red giant interior structure is confirmed: it yields a strong mass-radius relation for clump stars. We find that none of the amplitude scaling relations motivated by physical considerations predict the observed mode amplitudes of red giant stars. In parallel, the degreedependent mode visibility exhibits important variations. Both effects seem related to the significant influence of the high mode mass of non-radial mixed modes. A family of red giants with very weak dipole modes is identified, and its properties are analyzed. Conclusions. The clear correlation between the power densities of the background signal and of the stellar oscillation induces important consequences to be considered for deriving a reliable theoretical relation of the mode amplitude. As a by-product of this work, we have verified that red giant asteroseismology delivers new insights for stellar and Galactic physics, given the evidence for mass loss at the tip of the red giant branch.},

  abstract = {Methods. We perform a thorough characterization of the global seismic parameters of depressed dipole modes and show that these modes have a mixed character. The observation of stars showing dipole mixed modes that are depressed is especially useful for deriving model-independent conclusions on the dipole mode damping. We use a simple model to explain how mode visibilities are connected to the extra damping seen in depressed modes. Results. Observations prove that depressed dipole modes in red giants are not pure pressure modes but mixed modes. This result, observed in more than 90\% of the bright stars (mV {$\leq$} 11), invalidates the hypothesis that depressed dipole modes result from the suppression of the oscillation in the radiative core of the stars. Observations also show that, except for visibility, seismic properties of the stars with depressed modes are equivalent to those of normal stars. The measurement of the extra damping that is responsible for the reduction of mode amplitudes, without any prior on its physical nature, potentially provides an efficient tool for elucidating the mechanism responsible for the mode depression. Conclusions. The mixed nature of the depressed modes in red giants and their unperturbed global seismic parameters carry strong constraints on the physical mechanism responsible for the damping of the oscillation in the core. This mechanism is able to damp the oscillation in the core but cannot fully suppress it. Moreover, it cannot modify the radiative cavity probed by the gravity component of the mixed modes. The recent mechanism involving high magnetic fields proposed for explaining depressed modes is not compliant with the observations and cannot be used to infer the strength and prevalence of high magnetic fields in red giants.},

This new method was automated so that it could be applied to a large sample of stars. \emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}Coupling factors of mixed modes were measured for thousands of red giants. They show specific variation with mass and evolutionary stage. Weak coupling is observed for the most evolved stars on the red giant branch only; large coupling factors are measured at the transition between subgiants and red giants as well as in the red clump.\emph{Conclusions. {$<$}i/{$>$}The measurement of coupling factors in dipole mixed modes provides a new insight into the inner interior structure of evolved stars. While the large frequency separation and the asymptotic period spacings probe the envelope and core, respectively, the coupling factor is directly sensitive to the intermediate region in between and helps determine its extent. Observationally, the determination of the coupling factor is a prior to precise fits of the mixed-mode pattern and can now be used to address further properties of the mixed-mode pattern, such as the signature of buoyancy glitches and core rotation.}}}}}},

Ensemble asteroseismology, namely the examination of a large number of red giants at different stages of their evolution, allows us to derive global information on stellar evolution. Results. We have measured rotational splittings in a sample of about 300 red giants. We have also shown that these splittings are dominated by the core rotation. Under the assumption that a linear analysis can provide the rotational splitting, we observe a small increase of the core rotation of stars ascending the red giant branch. Alternatively, an important slow down is observed for red-clump stars compared to the red giant branch. We also show that, at fixed stellar radius, the specific angular momentum increases with increasing stellar mass. Conclusions. Ensemble asteroseismology indicates what has been indirectly suspected for a while: our interpretation of the observed rotational splittings leads to the conclusion that the mean core rotation significantly slows down during the red giant phase. The slowdown occurs in the last stages of the red giant branch. This spinning down explains, for instance, the long rotation periods measured in white dwarfs.},

The analysis of these spectra requires efficient methods of identifying all eigenmode parameters.  Methods: The assumption of new scaling laws allowed us to construct a theoretical oscillation pattern. We then obtained a highly precise determination of the large separation by correlating the observed patterns with this reference. Results: We demonstrate that this pattern is universal and are able to unambiguously assign the eigenmode radial orders and angular degrees. This solves one of the remaining problems of asteroseismology, hence allowing precise theoretical investigation of red-giant interiors.},

  abstract = {Stellar evolution codes play a major role in present-day astrophysics, yet they share common simplifications related to the outer layers of stars. We seek to improve on this by the use of results from realistic and highly detailed 3D hydrodynamics simulations of stellar convection. We implement a temperature stratification extracted directly from the 3D simulations into two stellar evolution codes to replace the simplified atmosphere normally used. Our implementation also contains a non-constant mixing-length parameter, which varies as a function of the stellar surface gravity and temperature \textendash{} also derived from the 3D simulations. We give a detailed account of our fully consistent implementation and compare to earlier works, and also provide a freely available MESA-module. The evolution of low-mass stars with different masses is investigated, and we present for the first time an asteroseismic analysis of a standard solar model utilizing calibrated convection and temperature stratification from 3D simulations. We show that the inclusion of 3D results has an almost insignificant impact on the evolution and structure of stellar models \textendash{} the largest effect are changes in effective temperature of order 30 K seen in the pre-main sequence and in the red-giant branch. However, this work provides the first step for producing self-consistent evolutionary calculations using fully incorporated 3D atmospheres from on-the-fly interpolation in grids of simulations.},

  abstract = {Within the variety of objects populating stellar clusters, blue straggler stars (BSSs) are among the most puzzling ones. BSSs are commonly found in globular clusters, but they are also known to populate open clusters of the Milky Way. Two main theoretical scenarios (collisions and mass transfer) have been suggested to explain their formation, although finding observational evidence in support of either scenario represents a challenging task. Among the APOGEE observations of the old open cluster M67, we found 8 BSS candidates known from the literature and two known evolved BSSs. We carried out a chemical analysis of 3 BSS candidates and of the 2 evolved BSSs out of the sample and found that the BSS candidates have surface abundances similar to those of stars on the main-sequence turn-off of M67. Especially the absence of any anomaly in their carbon abundances seems to support a collisional formation scenario for these stars. Furthermore, we note that the abundances of the evolved BSSs S1040 and S1237 are consistent with the abundances of the red clump stars of M67. In particular, they show a depletion in carbon by {$\sim$} 0.25 dex, which could be either interpreted as the signature of mass transfer or as the product of stellar evolutionary processes. Finally, we summarise the properties of the individual BSS stars observed by APOGEE, as derived from their APOGEE spectra and/or from information available in the literature.},

Those instruments have provided an unprecedented large amount of information, which allows us to scrutinize its statistical properties in the quest for hidden relations among pulsational and/or physical observables. This approach might be particularly useful for stars whose pulsation content is difficult to interpret. This is the case of intermediate-mass classical pulsating stars (i.e. {$\gamma$} Dor, {$\delta$} Scuti, hybrids) for which current theories do not properly predict the observed oscillation spectra. Here, we establish a first step in finding such hidden relations from data mining techniques for these stars. We searched for those hidden relations in a sample of {$\delta$} Scuti and hybrid stars observed by COROT and Kepler (74 and 153, respectively). No significant correlations between pairs of observables were found. However, two statistically significant correlations emerged from multivariable correlations in the observed seismic data, which describe the total number of observed frequencies and the largest one, respectively. Moreover, three different sets of stars were found to cluster according to their frequency density distribution. Such sets are in apparent agreement with the asteroseismic properties commonly accepted for A-F pulsating stars.},

The models match the observed temperature and low metallicity, finding a mass of 1.50\textendash 1.56 M . The models suggest that the whole star is metal poor, and that the low metallicity is not just a surface abundance peculiarity.

The latter observation indicates that Kepler data are not normally distributed. Moreover, a close inspection of the Pre-search Data Conditioned long-cadence data shows residuals that have increased noise on time-scales important to asteroseismology, but unimportant to planet searches.},

We use entire 4 yr light curves to accurately measure the frequencies of the strongest pulsation modes, and then track the pulsation phases at those frequencies in 10-d segments. This produces a series of time-delay measurements in which binarity is apparent as a periodic modulation whose amplitude gives the projected light travel time across the orbit. Fourier analysis of this time-delay curve provides the parameters of the orbit, including the period, eccentricity, angle of ascending node, and time of periastron passage. Differentiating the time-delay curve yields the full radial-velocity curve directly from the Kepler photometry, without the need for spectroscopy. We show examples with {$\delta$} scuti stars having large numbers of pulsation modes, including one system in which both components of the binary are pulsating. The method is straightforward to automate, thus radial velocity curves can be derived for hundreds of non-eclipsing binary stars from Kepler photometry alone.},

  abstract = {We explore the detection limits of the phase modulation (PM) method of finding binary systems among multiperiodic pulsating stars. The method is an attractive way of finding non-transiting planets in the habitable zones of intermediate-mass stars, whose rapid rotation inhibits detections via the radial velocity (RV) method. While oscillation amplitudes of a few mmag are required to find planets, many {$\delta$} Scuti stars have these amplitudes. In suboptimal cases where the signal to noise of the oscillations is lower, low-mass brown dwarfs ({$\sim$}13MJup) are detectable at orbital periods longer than about 1 yr, and the lowest mass main-sequence stars (0.1\textendash 0.2 M ) are detectable at all orbital periods where the PM method can be applied. We use purpose-written Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) software for the calculation of the PM orbits, which offers robust uncertainties for comparison with RV solutions. Using Kepler data and ground-based RVs, we verify that these two methods are in agreement, even at short orbital periods where the PM method undersamples the orbit. We develop new theory to account for the undersampling of the time delays, which is also necessary for the inclusion of RVs as observational data in the MCMC software. We show that combining RVs with time delays substantially refines the orbits because of the complementarity of working in both the spatial (PM) and velocity (RV) domains simultaneously. Software outputs were tested through an extensive hare-and-hounds exercise, covering a wide range of orbital configurations including binaries containing two pulsators.},

  abstract = {The orbital parameters of binaries at intermediate periods (102\textendash 103 d) are difficult to measure with conventional methods and are very incomplete. We have undertaken a new survey, applying our pulsation timing method to Kepler light curves of 2224 main-sequence A/F stars and found 341 non-eclipsing binaries. We calculate the orbital parameters for 317 PB1 systems (single-pulsator binaries) and 24 PB2s (double-pulsators), tripling the number of intermediate-mass binaries with full orbital solutions. The method reaches down to small mass ratios q {$\approx$} 0.02 and yields a highly homogeneous sample. We parametrize the massratio distribution using both inversion and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo forward-modelling techniques, and find it to be skewed towards low-mass companions, peaking at q {$\approx$} 0.2. While solar-type primaries exhibit a brown dwarf desert across short and intermediate periods, we find a small but statistically significant (2.6{$\sigma$} ) population of extreme-mass-ratio companions (q {$<$} 0.1) to our intermediate-mass primaries. Across periods of 100\textendash 1500 d and at q {$>$} 0.1, we measure the binary fraction of current A/F primaries to be 15.4 per cent {$\pm$} 1.4 per cent, though we find that a large fraction of the companions (21 per cent {$\pm$} 6 per cent) are white dwarfs in post-mass-transfer systems with primaries that are now blue stragglers, some of which are the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, barium stars, symbiotics, and related phenomena. Excluding these white dwarfs, we determine the binary fraction of original A/F primaries to be 13.9 per cent {$\pm$} 2.1 per cent over the same parameter space. Combining our measurements with those in the literature, we find the binary fraction across these periods is a constant 5 per cent for primaries M1 {$<$} 0.8 M , but then increases linearly with log M1, demonstrating that natal discs around more massive protostars M1 1 M become increasingly more prone to fragmentation. Finally, we find the eccentricity distribution of the main-sequence pairs to be much less eccentric than the thermal distribution.},

  abstract = {Rotation is a key physical process operating in the A stars. We present a method by which rotation periods might be measured with Fourier transforms of Kepler data, potentially removing the requirement of spectroscopic observations to acquire similar information. Angular rotational velocities reach their maximum at about A5, but slowly rotating A stars are also seen and these tend to be chemically peculiar. For Ap stars, rotational braking is understood, but too few progenitors are observed. A review of a rare class of stars, the `sn' stars, leads us to suggest these may contribute to the `missing' Ap progenitors. For Am stars, we find the tidal braking mechanisms proposed in the literature induce mixing that is incompatible with observed abundance anomalies. At the other end of the scale are the {$\lambda$} Boo stars, whose rotation velocities are above average. The two main theories for the origin of their metal underabundances are discussed and it is suggested that both of them imply the {$\lambda$} Boo stars contain a high fraction of pulsators -- a suggestion that is backed up by observations in the literature. Many {$\lambda$} Boo stars also have circumstellar material, suggesting they are potential planet hosts. This, and the use of asteroseismology to study their interiors, are two excellent reasons to adopt them as prime targets for detailed investigation with Kepler. Pulsation is a common phenomenon in A stars. The {$\delta$} Sct stars receive wide attention but the fraction of stars that pulsate at the 50 {$\mu$}mag level is shown to be only 56 percent. The non-{$\delta$} Sct stars in the {$\delta$} Sct instability strip receive far less attention. Some of these stars, without appreciable granulation or stellar winds, are probably the least variable objects on the HR diagram. It is shown that they have the potential to be among the most peculiar Am stars. Their investigation has led to two important conclusions: (1) the presence of {$\gamma$} Dor pulsation in non-{$\delta$} Sct stars in the {$\delta$} Sct instability strip may inhibit the development of the expected Am peculiarities; and (2) chemically normal, non-{$\delta$} Sct stars in the {$\delta$} Sct instability strip do exist at the {$\mu$}mag level. Fourier transforms are invaluable tools in the field of stellar pulsation. The Kepler Space Telescope is providing data of exquisite precision, and thus more detail is seen in the Fourier transform than ever before. Truly understanding the properties of the data is fundamental to their successful utilisation. Through statistical analysis of noise levels in over 20,000 stars, granulation is concluded to be visible in Fourier transforms of stars cooler than 7500 K. Another property investigated is the Nyquist frequency. We found that periodically modulated sampling on board Kepler allows distinction between real pulsation frequencies and Nyquist aliases, even when those real frequencies exceed the Nyquist frequency of the data. This discovery opens up study of many hundreds of stars previously thought to have insurmountable Nyquist ambiguities in their data.},

  abstract = {We used Kepler photometry to determine the internal rotation rate of KIC 7661054, a chemically normal {$\gamma$} Dor star on the main sequence at spectral type F2.5 V. The core rotation period of 27.25 {$\pm$} 0.06 d is obtained from the rotational splittings of a series of dipole g modes. The surface rotation period is calculated from a spectroscopic projected rotation velocity and a stellar radius computed from models. Literature data, obtained without inclusion of macroturbulence as a line-broadening mechanism, imply that the surface rotates much more quickly than the core, while our detailed analysis suggests that the surface may rotate slightly more quickly than the core and that the rotation profile is uniform within the 1{$\sigma$} uncertainties. We discuss the pitfalls associated with the determination of surface rotation rates of slow rotators from spectroscopy in the absence of asteroseismic constraints. A broad signal is observed at low frequency, which we show cannot be attributed to rotation, contrary to previous suggestions concerning the origin of such signals.},

Masses and radii are rarely constrained better than when measured via orbital dynamics and eclipse depths. Pulsating binaries have much to offer. They are clocks, moving in space, that encode orbital motion in the Doppler-shifted pulsation frequencies. They offer twice the opportunity to obtain an asteroseismic age, which is then applicable to both stars. They enable comparative asteroseismology -- the study of two stars by their pulsation properties, whose only fundamental differences are the mass and rotation rates with which they were born. In eccentric binaries, oscillations can be excited tidally, informing our knowledge of tidal dissipation and resonant frequency locking. Eclipsing binaries offer benchmarks against which the asteroseismic scaling relations can be tested. We review these themes in light of both observational and theoretical developments recently made possible by space-based photometry.},

Spectral classification and abundance analyses from high-resolution spectroscopy allow us to identify chemically peculiar stars, in which the absence of pulsations is not surprising. The remaining stars are chemically normal, yet they are not {$\delta$} Sct stars. Their lack of observed p modes cannot be explained through any known mechanism. However, they are mostly distributed around the edges of the {$\delta$} Sct instability strip, which allows for the possibility that they actually lie outside the strip once the uncertainties are taken into account. We investigated the possibility that the non-pulsators inside the instability strip could be unresolved binary systems, having components that both lie outside the instability strip. If misinterpreted as single stars, we found that such binaries could generate temperature discrepancies of {$\sim$}300 K \textendash{} larger than the spectroscopic uncertainties, and fully consistent with the observations. After these considerations, there remains one chemically normal nonpulsator that lies in the middle of the instability strip. This star is a challenge to pulsation theory. However, its existence as the only known star of its kind indicates that such stars are rare. We conclude that the {$\delta$} Sct instability strip is pure, unless pulsation is shut down by diffusion or another mechanism, which could be interaction with a binary companion.},

We studied the dependence of the observed properties of exoplanets (radius, mass, and orbital period) as a function of their host star metallicity. We analyzed the planetary radii and orbital periods of over 2800 Kepler candidates from the latest Kepler data release, DR25 (Q1-Q17), with revised planetary radii based on Gaia DR2 as a function of host star metallicity (from the Q1-Q17 (DR25) stellar and planet catalog). With a much larger sample and improved radius measurements, we are able to reconfirm previous results in the literature. We show that the average metallicity of the host star increases as the radius of the planet increases. We demonstrate this by first calculating the average host star metallicity for different radius bins and then supplementing these results by calculating the occurrence rate as a function of planetary radius and host star metallicity. We find a similar trend between host star metallicity and planet mass: the average host star metallicity increases with increasing planet mass. This trend, however, reverses for masses \&gt;4.0 M \textsubscript{J}: host star metallicity drops with increasing planetary mass. We further examined the correlation between the host star metallicity and the orbital period of the planet. We find that for planets with orbital periods less than 10 days, the average metallicity of the host star is higher than that for planets with periods greater than 10 days.},

These period changes challenge standard theories of pulsation and evolution because the period change is non-secular, and explaining this period jitter is necessary for understanding stellar evolution and the role of Cepheids as precise standard candles. We suggest that convection and convective hot spots can explain the observed period jitter. Convective hot spots alter the timing of flux maximum and minimum in the Cepheid light curve, hence change the measured pulsation period. We present a model of random hot spots that generate a localized flux excess that perturbs the Cepheid light curve and consequently the pulsation period, which is consistent with the observed jitter. This result demonstrates how important understanding convection is for modeling Cepheid stellar structure and evolution, how convection determines the red edge of the instability strip, and just how sensitive Cepheid light curves are to atmospheric physics.},

  abstract = {Context. A previous study of solar twin stars has revealed the existence of correlations between some abundance ratios and stellar age providing new knowledge about nucleosynthesis and Galactic chemical evolution. Aims. High-precision abundances of elements are determined for stars with asteroseismic ages in order to test the solar twin relations. Methods. HARPS-N spectra with signal-to-noise ratios S /N 250 and MARCS model atmospheres were used to derive abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, and Y in ten stars from the Kepler LEGACY sample (including the binary pair 16 Cyg A and B) selected to have metallicities in the range -0.15 {$<$} [Fe/H] {$<$} +0.15 and ages between 1 and 7 Gyr. Stellar gravities were obtained from seismic data and effective temperatures were determined by comparing non-LTE iron abundances derived from Fe i and Fe ii lines. Available non-LTE corrections were also applied when deriving abundances of the other elements.},

Our aim is to explore whether masses derived from spectroscopy and isochrone fitting may have been systematically overestimated. Our targets have all previously been subject to longterm radial velocity observations to detect orbiting bodies, and satisfy the criteria used by Johnson et al. to select survey stars which may have had A-type (or early F-type) mainsequence progenitors. The sample actually spans a somewhat wider range in mass, from {$\approx$}1 M up to {$\approx$}1.7 M . Whilst for five of the seven stars the reported discovery mass from spectroscopy exceeds the mass estimated using asteroseismology, there is no strong evidence for a significant, systematic bias across the sample. Moreover, comparisons with other masses from the literature show that the absolute scale of any differences is highly sensitive to the chosen reference literature mass, with the scatter between different literature masses significantly larger than reported error bars. We find that any mass difference can be explained through use of different constraints during the recovery process. We also conclude that underestimated uncertainties on the input parameters can significantly bias the recovered stellar masses, which may have contributed to the controversy on the mass scale for retired A stars.},

  abstract = {Asteroseismic forward modelling techniques are being used to determine fundamental properties (e.g. mass, radius, and age) of solar-type stars. The need to take into account all possible sources of error is of paramount importance towards a robust determination of stellar properties. We present a study of 34 solar-type stars for which high signal-to-noise asteroseismic data are available from multiyear Kepler photometry. We explore the internal systematics on the stellar properties, that is associated with the uncertainty in the input physics used to construct the stellar models. In particular, we explore the systematics arising from (i) the inclusion of the diffusion of helium and heavy elements; (ii) the uncertainty in solar metallicity mixture; and (iii) different surface correction methods used in optimization/fitting procedures. The systematics arising from comparing results of models with and without diffusion are found to be 0.5 per cent, 0.8 per cent, 2.1 per cent, and 16 per cent in mean density, radius, mass, and age, respectively. The internal systematics in age are significantly larger than the statistical uncertainties. We find the internal systematics resulting from the uncertainty in solar metallicity mixture to be 0.7 per cent in mean density, 0.5 per cent in radius, 1.4 per cent in mass, and 6.7 per cent in age. The surface correction method by Sonoi et al. and Ball \& Gizon's two-term correction produce the lowest internal systematics among the different correction methods, namely, {$\sim$}1 per cent, {$\sim$}1 per cent, {$\sim$}2 per cent, and {$\sim$}8 per cent in mean density, radius, mass, and age, respectively. Stellar masses obtained using the surface correction methods by Kjeldsen et al. and Ball \& Gizon's one-term correction are systematically higher than those obtained using frequency ratios.},

  abstract = {In the asymptotic parameterization of mode frequencies, the phase function {$\epsilon$}({$\nu$}) completely specifies the detailed structure of the frequency eigenvalues. In practice, however, this function of frequency is reduced to a single scalar {$\epsilon$}, defined, particularly by observers, as the intercept of a least-squares fit to the frequencies against radial order, or via the central value of this function. The procedure by which this is done is not unique. We derive a few simple expressions relating various observational estimators of {$\epsilon$} for radial modes to each other, and to the underlying theoretical object. In particular we demonstrate that a ``reduced'' functional parameterization is both insensitive to mis-estimations of {$\Delta\nu$}, and easy to evaluate locally in terms of both observational and theoretical quantities. It has been shown previously that such a local definition of {$\epsilon$} can distinguish between stars on the ascending part of the red giant branch and those in the red clump. We find that this sensitivity to evolutionary stage arises from differences in the local frequency derivative of the underlying phase function, a consequence of differences in internal structure. By constructing an H-R-like diagram out of purely seismic observables, we provide a unified view of the Kepler asteroseismic sample, as well as the initial results from TESS. We investigate how various astrophysical quantities and modeling parameters affect the morphology of isochrones on this seismic diagram. We also show that {$\epsilon$} can be used as an independent input when deriving stellar parameters from global asteroseismic quantities.},

The interstellar reddenings, metallicities, distances, and ages have been compared to the literature values. Significant differences are usually due to the usage of diverse empirical calibrations and differing assumptions, such as concerning cluster metallicity, as well as distinct isochrones which correspond to differing element-abundance ratios, internal stellar physics, and photometric systems. Different interstellar reddenings, as well as varying reduction and cluster-membership techniques, are also responsible for these kinds of systematic differences and errors. The morphological ages, which are derived from the morphological indices ({$\delta$}V and {$\delta$}1) in the CM diagrams, are in good agreement with the isochrone ages of 12OCs, those with good red clump (RC) and red giant (RG) star candidates. No metal abundance gradient is detected for the range 6.82{$\leqslant$}RGC{$\leqslant$}15.37kpc, nor any correlation between the cluster ages and metal abundances for these 20OCs. Young, metal-poor OCs, observed here in the third Galactic quadrant, may be associated with stellar over-densities, such as that in Canis Major (Martin et al.) and the Monoceros Ring (Newberg et al.), or signatures of past accretion events, as discussed by Yong et al. and Carraro et al.},

Like most of these stars, it displays a rich g-mode pulsation spectrum with several clear multiplets that maintain regular frequency splitting. We identify these pulsation modes as components of rotationally split multiplets in a star rotating with a period of {$\sim$}41 d. From 162 clearly significant periodicities, we are able to identify 156 as likely components of = 1 or = 2 multiplets. For the first time we are able to detect = 1 modes that interpose in the asymptotic period sequences and that provide a clear indication of mode trapping in a stratified envelope, as predicted by theoretical models. A clear signal is also present in the Kepler photometry at 3.387 d. Spectroscopic observations reveal a radial-velocity amplitude of 64.8 km s-1. We find that the radial-velocity variations and the photometric signal have phase and amplitude that are perfectly consistent with a Doppler-beaming effect and conclude that the unseen companion, KIC 10553698B, must be a white dwarf most likely with a mass close to 0.6 M .},

Of the pulsators, one shows the strong, rapid pulsations typical of a V361 Hya-type sdB variable (sdBV); seven show long-period pulsation characteristics of V1093 Her-type sdBVs; and one shows low-amplitude pulsations with both short and long periods. We derive effective temperatures and surface gravities for all the subdwarf B stars in the sample and demonstrate that below the boundary region where hybrid sdB pulsators are found, all our targets are pulsating. For the stars hotter than this boundary temperature a low fraction of strong pulsators ({$<$}10 per cent) is confirmed. Interestingly, the short-period pulsator also shows a low-amplitude mode in the long-period region, and several of the V1093 Her pulsators show low-amplitude modes in the short-period region, indicating that hybrid behaviour may be common in these stars, also outside the boundary temperature region where hybrid pulsators have hitherto been found.},

  abstract = {While the vast majority of multiple-planet systems have orbital angular momentum axes that align with the spin axis of their host star, Kepler-56 is an exception: its two transiting planets are coplanar yet misaligned by at least 40\textdegree{} with respect to the rotation axis of their host star. Additional follow-up observations of Kepler-56 suggest the presence of a massive, non-transiting companion that may help explain this misalignment. We model the transit data along with Keck/HIRES and HARPS-N radial velocity data to update the masses of the two transiting planets and infer the physical properties of the third, non-transiting planet. We employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler to calculate the best-fitting orbital parameters and their uncertainties for each planet. We find the outer planet has a period of 1002{$\pm$}5 days and minimum mass of 5.61{$\pm$}0.38 MJup. We also place a 95\% upper limit of 0.80 m s-1 yr-1 on long-term trends caused by additional, more distant companions.},

Five of these systems with clear primary and secondary eclipses are eventually chosen to be analysed in detail after examining at the pixel level to avoid contaminations. We first separate the oscillating signals and the eclipsing signals mixed in each light curve, and then apply asteroseismic analysis and binary modelling. Finally, we obtain absolute masses, radii, and orbital elements of both components for KIC 4054905, 9153621, and 10074700. The data processing procedures and the parameter analysis in this paper alleviate the requirements of radial velocity observations.},

In particular, several analyses have demonstrated the possibility to detect non-uniform period spacings, which have been predicted to be directly related to rotation. In this paper, we define a new seismic diagnostic for rotation in {$\gamma$} Doradus stars which are too rapidly rotating to present rotational splittings. Based on the non-uniformity of their period spacings, we define the observable as the slope of the period spacing when plotted as a function of period. We provide a one-to-one relation between this observable and the internal rotation, which applies widely in the instability strip of {$\gamma$} Doradus stars. We apply the diagnostic to a handful of stars observed by Kepler. Thanks to g modes in {$\gamma$} Doradus stars, we are now able to determine the internal rotation of stars on the lower main sequence, which is still not possible for Sun-like stars.},

The sdB star is a g-mode pulsator (a V1093 Her star) with periods ranging from 2384 s to 7643 s. Several of the pulsation modes show symmetric splitting by 0.62 {$\mu$}Hz.

The integrated parameters have been obtained for the whole cluster population as well as for the main-sequence (MS) population of star clusters. We have also estimated observed integrated magnitudes and colours of the MS population of galactic open clusters, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) star clusters. It is found that the colour evolution of the MS population of star clusters is not affected by the stochastic fluctuations, however, these fluctuations significantly affect the colour evolution of the whole cluster population. The fluctuations are maximum in (V - I) colour in the age range 6.7 \&lt; log(age) \&lt; 7.5. Evolution of integrated colours of the MS population of clusters in the Milky Way, LMC and SMC, obtained in the present study is well explained by the present synthetic cluster model. The observed integrated (B - V) colours of the MS population of LMC star clusters having age \&gt;=500 Myr seem to be distributed around the Z = 0.004 model, whereas (V - I) colours are found to be bluer than those predicted by the Z = 0.004 model. The (V - I) versus (B - V) two-colour diagram for the MS population of the Milky Way star clusters shows a fair agreement between the observations and present model, however, the diagrams for LMC and SMC clusters indicate that observed (V - I) colours are relatively bluer. Possible reasons for this anomaly have been discussed. Comparison of the synthetic (U - B) versus (B - V) relation with the observed integrated parameters of the whole cluster population of the Milky Way, LMC and SMC star clusters indicates that the majority of the bluest clusters [(B - V)\textsubscript{0} \&lt; 0.0] follow the MS population relation. The colour evolution of young Milky Way, LMC and SMC clusters [6.5 \&lt;= log(age) \&lt;=8.0] also indicates that a large number of young clusters follow the MS population relation. Therefore, in the absence of a careful modelling of stochastic effects, age determination of young star clusters by comparing their integrated colours with whole cluster synthetic colours may yield erroneous results.},

  abstract = {Metallicity is one of four free parameters typically considered when fitting isochrones to the cluster sequence. Unfortunately, this parameter is often ignored or assumed to be solar in most papers. Hence an unknown bias is introduced in the estimation of the other three cluster parameters (age, reddening and distance). Furthermore, studying the metallicity of open clusters allows us not only to derive the Galactic abundance gradient on a global scale, but also to trace the local solar environment in more detail. In a series of three papers, we investigate the current status of published metallicities for open clusters from widely different photometric and spectroscopic methods. A detailed comparison of the results allows us to establish more reliable photometric calibrations and corrections for isochrone fitting techniques. Well established databases such as WEBDA help us to perform a homogeneous analysis of available measurements for a significant number of open clusters. The literature was searched for [Fe/H] estimates on the basis of photometric calibrations in any available filter system. On the basis of results published by Tadross, we demonstrate the caveats of the calibration choice and its possible impact. In total, we find 406 individual metallicity values for 188 open clusters within 64 publications. The values were, finally, unweightedly averaged. Our final sample includes [Fe/H] values for 188 open clusters. Tracing the solar environment within 4000x4000 pc**2 we identify a patchy metallicity distribution as an extension to the Local Bubble that significantly influences the estimation of the Galactic metallicity gradient, even on a global scale.

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

  abstract = {For flares to be generated, stars have to have a sufficiently deep outer convection zone (F5 and later), strong large-scale magnetic fields (Ap/Bp-type stars) or strong, radiatively driven winds (B5 and earlier). Normal A-type stars possess none of these and therefore should not flare. Nevertheless, flares have previously been detected in the Kepler light curves of 33 A-type stars and interpreted to be intrinsic to the stars. Here, we present new and detailed analyses of these 33 stars, imposing very strict criteria for the flare detection. We confirm the presence of flare-like features in 27 of the 33 A-type stars. A study of the pixel data and the surrounding field of view reveals that 14 of these 27 flaring objects have overlapping neighbouring stars and five stars show clear contamination in the pixel data. We have obtained high-resolution spectra for 2/3 of the entire sample and confirm that our targets are indeed A-type stars. Detailed analyses revealed that 11 out of 19 stars with multiple epochs of observations are spectroscopic binaries. Furthermore, and contrary to previous studies, we find that the flares can originate from a cooler, unresolved companion. We note the presence of H{$\alpha$} emission in eight stars. Whether this emission is circumstellar or magnetic in origin is unknown. In summary, we find possible alternative explanations for the observed flares for at least 19 of the 33 A-type stars, but find no truly convincing target to support the hypothesis of flaring A-type stars.},

The models in these grids are compared to a set of benchmark models to evaluate their capability of mimicking the dipole prograde g-modes of the benchmark models. Results. Through our model comparisons we find that at a central hydrogen content of Xc = 0.5, dipole prograde g-modes in the period range 0.8\textendash 3 d are capable of differentiating between step and exponential diffusive overshooting. This ability disappears towards the terminal age main sequence at Xc = 0.1. Furthermore, the g-modes behave the same for the three different shapes of radiative envelope mixing considered. However, a constant envelope mixing requires a diffusion coefficient near the convective core five times higher than chemical mixing from internal gravity waves to obtain a surface nitrogen excess of {$\sim$}0.5 dex within the main-sequence lifetime. Conclusions. Within the estimated frequency errors of the Kepler mission, the ability of g-modes to distinguish between step and exponential diffusive overshooting depends on the evolutionary stage. Combining information from the average period spacing and observed surface abundances, notably nitrogen, could potentially be used to constrain the shape of mixing in the radiative envelope of massive stars.},

  abstract = {The old open cluster NGC 6791 is believed to be more metal-rich than any other, yet several hot blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars are probable members. We have performed an abundance analysis of the coolest BHB candidate, 2-17, whose proper motion and radial velocity both support cluster membership. Its luminosity and its low rotational velocity, v sin i =16 {$\pm$} 1 km s -1 , suggest that it is a BHB star rather than a very luminous blue straggler. We find an effective temperature T eff =7300 {$\pm$} 50 K, gravity log g =3.6 {$\pm$} 0.3 dex, and an iron abundance more than twice solar, [Fe/H]=+0.4 {$\pm$} 0.1 dex. This result is free from the serious line blending and continuum suppression that hamper spectroscopic analyses of metal-rich giants. The Ca abundance is in the solar proportion with respect to iron, ruling out A-star peculiarities in 2-17. The relative abundances of C, O, and Al are nearly solar; mixing effects are probably small but not ruled out. The light elements Mg and Si are enhanced, N and Na especially so, as seen in metal-rich galaxies. NGC 6791 thus provides an excellent template for the study of the stellar content of metal-rich galactic systems. Both its abundances and its continued existence suggest that metal-rich systems might generally form in locally deep potential wells. Further study of its hot population should clarify the mechanisms responsible for producing hot stars in a metal-rich environment and thus assist the interpretation of the integrated light and the ultraviolet upturn in elliptical galaxies.},

  abstract = {The space-borne missions CoRoT and Kepler have already brought stringent constraints on the internal structure of low-mass evolved stars, a large part of which results from the detection of mixed modes. However, all the potential of these oscillation modes as a diagnosis of the stellar interior has not been fully exploited yet. In particular, the coupling factor or the gravity-offset of mixed modes, \$q\$ and \$\textbackslash varepsilon\_\{\textbackslash rm g\}\$, are expected to provide additional constraints on the mid-layers of red giants, which are located between the hydrogen-burning shell and the neighborhood of the base of the convective zone. In the present paper, we investigate the potential of the coupling factor in probing the mid-layer structure of evolved stars. Guided by typical stellar models and general physical considerations, we modeled the coupling region along with evolution. We subsequently obtained an analytical expression of \$q\$ based on the asymptotic theory of mixed modes and compared it to observations. We show that the value of \$q\$ is degenerate with respect to the thickness of the coupling evanescent region and the local density scale height. A structural interpretation of the global variations in \$q\$ observed on the subgiant and the red giant branches, as well as on the red clump, was obtained in the light of this model. We demonstrate that \$q\$ has the promising potential to probe the migration of the base of the convective region as well as convective extra-mixing in evolved red giant stars with typically \$\textbackslash nu\_\{\textbackslash rm max\} \textbackslash lesssim 100\textasciitilde\textbackslash mu\$Hz. We also show that the frequency-dependence of \$q\$ cannot be neglected in the oscillation spectra of such stars, which is in contrast with what is assumed in the current measurement methods. This analytical study paves the way for a more quantitative exploration of the link of \$q\$ with the internal properties of evolved stars using stellar models.},

  abstract = {We present a catalog of revised effective temperatures for stars observed in long-cadence mode in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We use Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) griz filters tied to the fundamental temperature scale. Polynomials for griz color\textendash temperature relations are presented, along with correction terms for surface gravity effects, metallicity, and statistical corrections for binary companions or blending. We compare our temperature scale to the published infrared flux method (IRFM) scale for VT J Ks in both open clusters and the Kepler fields. We find good agreement overall, with some deviations between (J - Ks)-based temperatures from the IRFM and both SDSS filter and other diagnostic IRFM color\textendash temperature relationships above 6000 K. For field dwarfs, we find a mean shift toward hotter temperatures relative to the KIC, of order 215 K, in the regime where the IRFM scale is well defined (4000 K to 6500 K). This change is of comparable magnitude in both color systems and in spectroscopy for stars with Teff below 6000 K. Systematic differences between temperature estimators appear for hotter stars, and we define corrections to put the SDSS temperatures on the IRFM scale for them. When the theoretical dependence on gravity is accounted for, we find a similar temperature scale offset between the fundamental and KIC scales for giants. We demonstrate that statistical corrections to color-based temperatures from binaries are significant. Typical errors, mostly from uncertainties in extinction, are of order 100 K. Implications for other applications of the KIC are discussed.},

Our data includes evolutionary state, surface gravity, mean density, mass, radius, age, and the spectroscopic and asteroseismic measurements used to derive them. We employ a new empirical approach for combining asteroseismic measurements from different methods, calibrating the inferred stellar parameters, and estimating uncertainties. With high statistical significance, we find that asteroseismic parameters inferred from the different pipelines have systematic offsets that are not removed by accounting for differences in their solar reference values. We include theoretically motivated corrections to the large frequency spacing ({$\increment\nu$}) scaling relation, and we calibrate the zero point of the frequency of maximum power ({$\nu$}max) relation to be consistent with masses and radii for members of star clusters. For most targets, the parameters returned by different pipelines are in much better agreement than would be expected from the pipelinepredicted random errors, but 22\% of them had at least one method not return a result and a much larger measurement dispersion. This supports the usage of multiple analysis techniques for asteroseismic stellar population studies. The measured dispersion in mass estimates for fundamental calibrators is consistent with our error model, which yields median random and systematic mass uncertainties for RGB stars of order 4\%. Median random and systematic mass uncertainties are at the 9\% and 8\% level respectively for RC stars.},

Bias-free results are required.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$}We use methods of stellar statistics and develop a semi-empirical model of open clusters.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$}We check two effects impacting the determination of tidal radii from a fitting of King's profiles to the observed density distribution, i.e., ellipticity of open clusters and a bias depending on distances. Though a typical cluster has an elliptical form, the effect is rather weak to produce a prominent bias in the resulting tidal radii. In contrast, a distance dependent bias is not negligible and can cause a systematic underestimation of tidal radii computed with ASCC-2.5 data by a factor of two for the most distant clusters of our sample. This finding is used to correct the original results for 236 clusters and to extend the system of tidal radii and masses to all 650 clusters. We found that the semi-major axis of the projected distribution of cluster members on the sky is a parameter suited to estimate tidal radii of open clusters of our sample. No systematic differences are found between measured and calibrated tidal radii. From the comparison with mass estimates based on star counts and on the assumption of the Salpeter IMF, empirical evidence is obtained for an evolution of cluster mass functions starting in young clusters.\emph{Conclusions.{$<$}i/{$>$}The set of homogeneous parameters available for all clusters of our sample is extended by tidal radius and mass. Within 850 pc where our sample is complete, the distributions of tidal radii and masses peak at pc and , respectively.

  abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars that form the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. Several examples exist in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly abundant in starburst and interacting galaxies. The few YMCs that are close enough to resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and the ecological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. The distant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster mass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation mechanisms of young cluster populations. YMCs are expected to be the nurseries for many unusual objects, including a wide range of exotic stars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in YMCs, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are unusually rich in stellar exotica. In this review, we focus on star clusters younger than {$\sim$}100 Myr, more than a few current crossing times old, and more massive than {$\sim$}104M{$\odot$}; the size of the cluster and its environment are considered less relevant as distinguishing parameters. We describe the global properties of the currently known young massive star clusters in the Local Group and beyond, and discuss the state of the art in observations and dynamical modeling of these systems. In order to make this review readable by observers, theorists, and computational astrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary terminology.},

This has followed from the apparent homogeneity of the group, the large number present in the Galaxy, and their moderately high luminosities, which render them visible at large distances. However, in the past decade it has become clear that RR Lyrae stars are heterogeneous in many observable parameters. This heterogeneity limits their usefulness in some contexts and enhances their value in others. In addition to their applications in galactic research, the RR Lyrae stars are of current astrophysical interest on account of the line-doubling and emission that occur during rising light, the multiple periodicities found in many of them, and various other phase- and period-dependent phenomena that bear on the theory of stellar pulsation. In this review we summarize recent developments in these areas.},

  abstract = {In very young clusters, stellar age distribution is the empirical proof of the duration of star formation (SF) and of the physical mechanisms involved in the process. We derived accurate stellar ages for the cluster NGC6530, associated with the Lagoon Nebula to infer its SF history. We use the Gaia-ESO survey observations and Gaia DR2 data, to derive cluster membership and fundamental stellar parameters. We identified 652 confirmed and 9 probable members. The reddening inferred for members and non-members allows us to distinguish MS stars and giants, in agreement with the distances inferred from Gaia DR2 data. The foreground and background stars show a spatial pattern that traces the 3D structure of the nebular dust component. We derive stellar ages for 382 confirmed cluster members and we find that the gravity-sensitive gamma index distribution for M stars is correlated with stellar age. For all members with Teff{$<$}5500 K, the mean logarithmic age is 5.84 (units of years) with a dispersion of 0.36 dex. The age distribution of stars with accretion and/or disk (CTTSe) is similar to that of stars without accretion and without disk (WTTSp). We interpret this dispersion as evidence of a real age spread since the total uncertainties on age determinations, derived from Monte Carlo simulations, are significantly smaller than the observed spread. This conclusion is supported by the evidence of a decreasing of the gravity-sensitive gamma index as a function of stellar ages. The presence of the age spread is also supported by the spatial distribution and the kinematics of old and young members. In particular, members with accretion and/or disk, formed in the last 1 Myr, show evidence of subclustering around the cluster center, in the Hourglass Nebula and in the M8-E region, suggesting a possible triggering of star formation events by the O-type star ionization fronts.},

This large sample made it possible to carry out a systematic analysis of 481 open cluster orbits, using parameters based on orbit eccentricity and separation from the Galactic plane. These two parameters may be indicative of origin, and we find them to be correlated. We also find them to be correlated with metallicity, another parameter suggested elsewhere to be a marker for origin in that high values of any of these two parameters generally indicate a low metallicity ([Fe/H] Solar{$<-$}0.2dex). The resulting analysis points to four open clusters in the catalogue being of extra-Galactic origin by impact of high velocity cloud on the disk: Berkeley21, 32, 99, and Melotte66, with a possible further four due to this origin (NGC2158, 2420, 7789, IC1311). A further three may be due to Galactic globular cluster impact on the disk i.e of internal Galactic origin (NGC6791, 1817, and 7044).},

Globular clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 5053 and open cluster NGC 6791 are reduced in a homogeneous fashion yielding estimates of the distance moduli and extinctions and a possible color-gradient detection. A six-band optical/infrared survey of the recently-discovered nearby (97 {$\pm$} 4 pc) open cluster Eta Chamaeleontis is undertaken resulting in the identification of 11 new candidate members. A light echo candidate from Hubble Space Telescope imaging of NGC 2441 is identified in the host galaxy of the Type Ia supernova 1995E. From the echo's angular size and the estimated distance to the host galaxy, we find a distance of 207 {$\pm$} 35 pc between the dust and the site of the supernova. If confirmed, this echo brings the total number of observed non-historical Type Ia light echoes to three\textemdash the others being SN 1991T and SN 1998bu\textemdash suggesting they are not uncommon. We compare the properties of the known Type Ia supernova echoes and test various models of light echoes. HST photometry of the SN 1991T echo shows a fading which is consistent with scattering by dust distributed in a sphere or shell around the supernova.},

  abstract = {We present the results of a comprehensive assessment of companions to solar-type stars. A sample of 454 stars, including the Sun, was selected from the Hipparcos catalog with {$\pi\&$}gt;40 mas, {$\sigma$}\textsubscript{{$\pi$}}/{$\pi$} \&lt; 0.05, 0.5 \&lt;= B - V \&lt;= 1.0 (\textasciitilde F6-K3), and constrained by absolute magnitude and color to exclude evolved stars. These criteria are equivalent to selecting all dwarf and subdwarf stars within 25 pc with V-band flux between 0.1 and 10 times that of the Sun, giving us a physical basis for the term "solar-type." New observational aspects of this work include surveys for (1) very close companions with long-baseline interferometry at the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array, (2) close companions with speckle interferometry, and (3) wide proper-motion companions identified by blinking multi-epoch archival images. In addition, we include the results from extensive radial-velocity monitoring programs and evaluate companion information from various catalogs covering many different techniques. The results presented here include four new common proper-motion companions discovered by blinking archival images. Additionally, the spectroscopic data searched reveal five new stellar companions. Our synthesis of results from many methods and sources results in a thorough evaluation of stellar and brown dwarf companions to nearby Sun-like stars. The overall observed fractions of single, double, triple, and higher-order systems are 56\% {$\pm$} 2\%, 33\% {$\pm$} 2\%, 8\% {$\pm$} 1\%, and 3\% {$\pm$} 1\%, respectively, counting all confirmed stellar and brown dwarf companions. If all candidate, i.e., unconfirmed, companions identified are found to be real, the percentages would change to 54\% {$\pm$} 2\%, 34\% {$\pm$} 2\%, 9\% {$\pm$} 2\%, and 3\% {$\pm$} 1\%, respectively. Our completeness analysis indicates that only a few undiscovered companions remain in this well-studied sample, implying that the majority (54\% {$\pm$} 2\%) of solar-type stars are single, in contrast to the results of prior multiplicity studies. Our sample is large enough to enable a check of the multiplicity dependence on various physical parameters by analyzing appropriate subsamples. Bluer, more massive stars are seen as more likely to have companions than redder, less massive ones, consistent with the trend seen over the entire spectral range. Systems with larger interaction cross sections, i.e., those with more than two components or long orbital periods, are preferentially younger, suggesting that companions may be stripped over time by dynamical interactions. We confirm the planet-metallicity correlation (i.e., higher metallicity stars are more likely to host planets), but are unable to check it for brown dwarfs due to the paucity of such companions, implying that the brown dwarf desert extends over all separation regimes. We find no correlation between stellar companions and metallicity for B - V \&lt; 0.625, but among the redder subset, metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] \&lt;-0.3) are more likely to have companions with a 2.4{$\sigma$} significance. The orbital-period distribution of companions is unimodal and roughly log normal with a peak and median of about 300 years. The period-eccentricity relation shows the expected circularization for periods below 12 days, caused by tidal forces over the age of the Galaxy, followed by a roughly flat distribution. The mass-ratio distribution shows a preference for like-mass pairs, which occur more frequently in relatively close pairs. The fraction of planet hosts among single, binary, and multiple systems are statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that planets are as likely to form around single stars as they are around components of binary or multiple systems with sufficiently wide separations. This, along with the preference of long orbital periods among stellar systems, increases the space around stars conducive for planet formation, and perhaps life.},

Seventeen colors in the photometric systems UBV, uvby, Vilnius, Geneva, RI(Cousins), DDO, Hipparcos-Tycho, and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) have been calibrated. The spectral types covered by the calibrations range from F0 to K5 (7000K\&gt;\textasciitilde T\textsubscript{eff}\&gt;\textasciitilde 4000K) with some relations extending below 4000 K or up to 8000 K. Most of the calibrations are valid in the metallicity range -3.5\&gt;\textasciitilde [Fe/H]\&gt;\textasciitilde 0.4, although some of them extend to as low as [Fe/H]\textasciitilde -4.0. All fits to the data have been performed with more than 100 stars; standard deviations range from 30 to 120 K. Fits were carefully performed and corrected to eliminate the small systematic errors introduced by the calibration formulae. Tables of colors as a function of T\textsubscript{eff} and [Fe/H] are provided. This work is largely based on the study by A. Alonso and collaborators; thus, our relations do not significantly differ from theirs except for the very metal-poor hot stars. From the calibrations, the temperatures of 44 dwarf and giant stars with direct temperatures available are obtained. The comparison with direct temperatures confirms our finding in Paper I that the zero point of the IRFM temperature scale is in agreement, to the 10 K level, with the absolute temperature scale (that based on stellar angular diameters) within the ranges of atmospheric parameters covered by those 44 stars. The colors of the Sun are derived from the present IRFM T\textsubscript{eff} scale and they compare well with those of five solar analogs. It is shown that if the IRFM T\textsubscript{eff} scale accurately reproduces the temperatures of very metal-poor stars, systematic errors of the order of 200 K, introduced by the assumption of (V-K) being completely metallicity independent when studying very metal-poor dwarf stars, are no longer acceptable. Comparisons with other T\textsubscript{eff} scales, both empirical and theoretical, are also shown to be in reasonable agreement with our results, although it seems that both Kurucz and MARCS synthetic colors fail to predict the detailed metallicity dependence, given that for [Fe/H]=-2.0, differences as high as approximately +/-200 K are found.},

The Kepler light curve shows quasi-periodic behaviour with a mean period of 34 d and an amplitude of a few per cent. Using Swift data, we find a relatively strong UV source at the position of StHa 169 but no X-ray counterpart. Using a simple two-component blackbody fit to model the combined Swift and 2MASS spectral energy distribution and an assessment of the previously published optical spectrum, we find that the source has a hot ({$\sim$}10 000 K) component and a cooler ({$\sim$}3700 K) component. The Kepler light is dominated by the cool component and we attribute the variability to pulsations in a red giant star. If we remove this approximate month long modulation from the light curve, we find no evidence for additional variability in the light curve. The hotter source is assigned to a late B or early A main-sequence star. We briefly discuss the implications of these findings and conclude that StHA 169 is a red giant plus main-sequence binary.},

We find that every sdB star cooler than {$\approx$}27 500 K that Kepler has observed (seven so far) is a long-period pulsator of the V1093 Her (PG 1716) class or a hybrid star with both short and long periods. The apparently non-binary long-period and hybrid pulsators are described here. The V1093 Her periods range from 1 to 4.5 h and are associated with g-mode pulsations. Three stars also exhibit short periods indicative of p-modes with periods of 2\textendash 5 min and in addition, these stars exhibit periodicities between both classes from 15 to 45 min. We detect the coolest and longest-period V1093 Her-type pulsator to date, KIC010670103 (Teff {$\approx$} 20 900 K, Pmax {$\approx$} 4.5 h) as well as a suspected hybrid pulsator, KIC002697388, which is extremely cool (Teff {$\approx$} 23 900 K) and for the first time hybrid pulsators which have larger g-mode amplitudes than p-mode ones. All of these pulsators are quite rich with many frequencies and we are able to apply asymptotic relationships to associate periodicities with modes for KIC010670103. Kepler data are particularly well suited for these studies as they are long duration, extremely high duty cycle observations with well-behaved noise properties.},

We selected, analyzed, and characterized a sample of 67 {$\gamma$} Dor stars for which we have Kepler observations available. For all the targets in the sample we assembled high-resolution spectroscopy to confirm their F-type nature. We found fourteen binaries, among which are four single-lined binaries, five double-lined binaries, two triple systems, and three binaries with no detected radial velocity variations. We estimated the orbital parameters whenever possible. For the single stars and the single-lined binaries, fundamental parameter values were determined from spectroscopy. We searched for period spacing patterns in the photometric data and identified this diagnostic for 50 of the stars in the sample, 46 of which are single stars or single-lined binaries. We found a strong correlation between the spectroscopic v sin i and the period spacing values, confirming the influence of rotation on {$\gamma$} Dor-type pulsations as predicted by theory.

  abstract = {Methods. Using a recent sample of active stars we compute the rotation period and the variability amplitude for each individual Kepler quarter and search for periodic variations of both time series. To test for periodicity in each stellar time series we consider Lomb-Scargle periodograms and use a selection based on a false alarm probability (FAP). Results. We detect amplitude periodicities in 3203 stars between 0.5 {$<$} Pcyc {$<$} 6 yr covering rotation periods between 1 {$<$} Prot {$<$} 40 days. Given our sample size of 23 601 stars and our selection criteria that the FAP is less than 5\%, this number is almost three times higher than that expected from pure noise. We do not detect periodicities in the rotation period beyond those expected from noise. Our measurements reveal that the cycle period shows a weak dependence on rotation rate, slightly increasing for longer rotation periods. We further show that the shape of the variability deviates from a pure sine curve, consistent with observations of the solar cycle. The cycle shape does not show a statistically significant dependence on effective temperature. Conclusions. We detect activity cycles in more than 13\% of our final sample with a FAP of 5\% (calculated by randomly shuffling the measured 90-day variability measurements for each star). Our measurements do not support the existence of distinct sequences in the Prot - Pcyc plane, although there is some evidence for the inactive sequence for rotation periods between 5\textendash 25 days. Unfortunately, the total observing time is too short to draw sound conclusions on activity cycles with similar lengths to that of the solar cycle.},

  abstract = {Methods. Active stars were selected from the whole sample using the range of the variability amplitude. To detect different periods in the light curves we used the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in a pre-whitening approach to achieve parameters for a global sine fit. The most dominant periods from the fit were associated to different surface rotation periods. Our purely mathematical approach is capable of detecting different periods but cannot distinguish between the physical origins of periodicity. We ascribe the existence of different periods to DR, but spot evolution could also play a role. Because of the large number of stars the period errors are estimated statistically. We thus cannot exclude the existence of false positives among our periods. Results. In our sample of 40 661 active stars we found 24 124 rotation periods P1 between 0.5 and 45 days, with a mean of P1 = 16.3 days. The distribution of stars with 0.5 {$<$} B - V {$<$} 1.0 and ages derived from angular momentum evolution that are younger than 300 Myr is consistent with a constant star-formation rate; the detection among older stars is incomplete probably because of our active sample selection. A second period P2 within {$\pm$}30\% of the rotation period P1 was found in 18 616 stars (77.2\%). Attributing these two periods to DR we found that for active stars other than the Sun the relative shear {$\alpha$} increases with rotation period, and slightly decreases with effective temperature. The absolute shear {$\Delta\Omega$} slightly increases from {$\Delta\Omega$} = 0.079 rad d-1 at Teff = 3500 K to {$\Delta\Omega$} = 0.096 rad d-1 at Teff = 6000 K. Above 6000 K, {$\Delta\Omega$} shows much larger scatter. The dependence of {$\Delta\Omega$} on rotation period is weak over a large period range. Conclusions. Latitudinal differential rotation measured for the first time in more than 18 000 stars provides a comprehensive picture of stellar surface shear. This picture is consistent with major predictions from mean-field theory, and seems to support these models. To what extent our observations are prone to false positives and selection bias has not been fully explored, and needs to be addressed using other data, including the full Kepler time coverage.},

Treating the stars as 'sink particles', we track their birth angular momentum, and the later evolution of their angular momentum due to gas accretion. We find that in both clouds, the sinks have spin vectors that are aligned with one another, and with the global angular momentum vector of the star cluster. This alignment is present at birth, but enhanced by later gas accretion. In the compressive cloud, the sink-spins remain aligned with the gas for at least a free fall time. By contrast, in the shear cloud, the increased turbulent mixing causes the sinks to rapidly misalign with their birth cloud on approximately a gas free-fall time. In spite of this, both clouds show a strong alignment of sink-spins at the end of our simulations, independently of environment.},

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its two-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical CCD cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I\textsubscript{C} (approximately less than) 13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from one month to one year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10-100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every four months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

Our method takes into account the spectroscopic constraints derived from the APOGEE Stellar Parameters and Chemical Abundances Pipeline, together with the asteroseismic parameters from KASC. These parameters are then employed to estimate intrinsic stellar properties, including absolute magnitudes, using the Bayesian tool PARAM. We then find the distance and extinction that best fit the observed photometry in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), 2MASS, and WISE passbands. The first 1989 giants targetted by APOKASC are found at typical distances between 0.5 and 5 kpc, with individual uncertainties of just {$\sim$}1.8 per cent. Our extinction estimates are systematically smaller than provided in the Kepler Input Catalogue and by the Schlegel et al. maps. Distances to individual stars in the NGC 6791 and NGC 6819 star clusters agree to within their credible intervals. Comparison with the APOGEE red clump and SAGA catalogues provide another useful check, exhibiting agreement with our measurements to within a few per cent. Overall, present methods seem to provide excellent distance and extinction determinations for the bulk of the APOKASC sample. Approximately one third of the stars present broad or multiple-peaked probability density functions and hence increased uncertainties. Uncertainties are expected to be reduced in future releases of the catalogue, when a larger fraction of the stars will have seismically determined evolutionary status classifications.},

Most of such determinations are, up to now, based on simple scaling relations involving the large frequency separation, \textbackslash Delta\textbackslash nu, and the frequency of maximum power, \textbackslash nu\$\_\{max\}\$. In this work, we implement \textbackslash Delta\textbackslash nu\textbackslash{} and the period spacing, \{\textbackslash Delta\}P, computed along detailed grids of stellar evolutionary tracks, into stellar isochrones and hence in a Bayesian method of parameter estimation. Tests with synthetic data reveal that masses and ages can be determined with typical precision of 5 and 19 per cent, respectively, provided precise seismic parameters are available. Adding independent information on the stellar luminosity, these values can decrease down to 3 and 10 per cent respectively. The application of these methods to NGC 6819 giants produces a mean age in agreement with those derived from isochrone fitting, and no evidence of systematic differences between RGB and RC stars. The age dispersion of NGC 6819 stars, however, is larger than expected, with at least part of the spread ascribable to stars that underwent mass-transfer events.},

The occultation and transit with follow-up optical spectroscopy reveal a 9400 K early A-star, KOI-74 (KIC 6889235), with a companion in a 5.2 day orbit with a radius of 0.08 R and a 10,000 K late B-star KOI-81 (KIC 8823868) that has a companion in a 24 day orbit with a radius of 0.2 R . We infer a temperature of 12,250 K for KOI-74b and 13,500 K for KOI-81b. We present 43 days of high duty cycle, 30 minute cadence photometry, with models demonstrating the intriguing properties of these objects, and speculate on their nature.},

  abstract = {Aims. Our aim is to describe the theory of surface layer independent model fitting by phase matching and to apply this to the stars HD 49933 observed by CoRoT, and HD 177153 (aka Perky) observed by Kepler. Methods. We use theoretical analysis, phase shifts, and model fitting. Results. We define the inner and outer phase shifts of a frequency set of a model star and show that the outer phase shifts are (almost) independent of degree , and that a function of the inner phase shifts (the phase function) collapses to an independent function of frequency in the outer layers. We then show how to use this result in a model fitting technique to find a best fit model to an observed frequency set by calculating the inner phase shifts of a model using the observed frequencies and determining the extent to which the phase function collapses to a single function of frequency in the outer layers. This technique does not depend on the radial order n assigned to the observed frequencies. We give two examples applying this technique to the frequency sets of HD 49933 observed by CoRoT and HD 177153 (aka Perky) observed by Kepler, for which measurements of angular diameters and bolometric fluxes are available. For HD 49933 we find a very wide range of models to be consistent with the data (all with convective core overshooting) \textendash{} and conclude that the data is not precise enough to make any useful restrictions on the structure of this star. For HD 177153 our best fit models have no convective cores, masses in the range 1.15-1.17 M , ages of 4.45-4.70 \texttimes{} 109 yr, Z in the range 0.021-0.024, XH = 0.71-0.72, Y = 0.256-0.266 and mixing length parameter {$\alpha$} = 1.8. We compare our results to those of previous studies. We contrast the phase matching technique to that using the ratios of small to large separations, showing that it avoids the problem of correlated errors in separation ratio fitting and of assigning radial order n to the modes.},

  abstract = {SN 1572 (Tycho Brahe's supernova) clearly belongs to the Ia (thermonuclear) type. It was produced by the explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system. Its remnant has been the first of this type to be explored in search of a possible surviving companion, the mass donor that brought the white dwarf to the point of explosion. A high peculiar motion with respect to the stars at the same location in the Galaxy, mainly due to the orbital velocity at the time of the explosion, is a basic criterion for the detection of such companions. Radial velocities from the spectra of the stars close to the geometrical center of Tycho's supernova remnant, plus proper motions of the same stars, obtained by astrometry with the \{\textbackslash it Hubble Space Telescope\}, have been used so far. In addition, a detailed chemical analysis of the atmospheres of a sample of candidate stars had been made. However, the distances to the stars, remained uncertain. Now, the Second \{\textbackslash it Gaia\} Data Release (DR2) provides unprecedent accurate distances and new proper motions for the stars can be compared with those made from the \{\textbackslash it HST\}. We consider the Galactic orbits that the candidate stars to SN companion would have in the future. We do this to explore kinematic peculiarity. We also locate a representative sample of candidate stars in the Toomre diagram. Using the new data, we reevaluate here the status of the candidates suggested thus far, as well as the larger sample of the stars seen in the central region of the remnant.},

The shape of the radial density profile indicates that the corona, most probably, is the outer region around the cluster. It can exist from the very beginning of the cluster formation and dynamical evolution is not the reason for its occurrence. The study does not find any relation between cluster size and age but indicates that the clusters with galacto-centric distances {$>$}9.5 kpc have larger sizes. Further, we find that the average value of the core radius is pc and that of annular width of the corona is pc, while average values of densities of cluster members in the core and corona are star/pc\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$} and star/pc\textsuperscript{2{$<$}sup/{$>$} respectively. Average field star contaminations in the core and corona are \textasciitilde 35\% and 80\% respectively. In spite of smaller densities in the coronal region, it contains \textasciitilde 75\% of the cluster members due to its larger area in comparison to the core region. This clearly demonstrates the importance of the coronal region in studies dealing with the entire stellar contents of open star clusters as well as their dynamical evolution. In contrast to the cluster cores, the structure of coronal regions differs significantly from one cluster to other.}}},

We compute radii based on the asteroseismic scaling relations as well as by fitting observed oscillation frequencies to stellar models for a subset of the sample, and test the impact of using effective temperatures from either spectroscopy or the infrared flux method. An offset of 3 per cent, showing no dependency on any stellar parameters, is found between seismic parallaxes derived from frequency modelling and those from Gaia. For parallaxes based on radii from the scaling relations, a smaller offset is found on average; however, the offset becomes temperature dependent which we interpret as problems with the scaling relations at high stellar temperatures. Using the hotter infrared flux method temperature scale, there is no indication that radii from the scaling relations are inaccurate by more than about 5 per cent. Taking the radii and masses from the modelling of individual frequencies as reference values, we seek to correct the scaling relations for the observed temperature trend. This analysis indicates that the scaling relations systematically overestimate radii and masses at high temperatures, and that they are accurate to within 5 per cent in radius and 13 per cent in mass for main-sequence stars with temperatures below 6400 K. However, further analysis is required to test the validity of the corrections on a star-by-star basis and for more evolved stars.},

This is the second case, following KIC 11145123, of an asteroseismic determination of the rotation of the deep core and surface of an A-F main-sequence star. We have found, essentially model independently, that the rotation near the surface, obtained from p-mode splittings, is 66 d, slightly slower than the rotation of 64 d in the core, measured by g-mode splittings. KIC 9244992 is similar to KIC 11145123 in that both are near the end of main-sequence stage with very slow and nearly uniform rotation.

Until now, however, discussion of r modes (global Rossby waves) has been rare. Here we derive the expected frequency ranges of r modes in the observational frame by considering the visibility of these modes. We find that the frequencies of r modes of azimuthal order m appear as groups at slightly lower frequency than m times the rotation frequency. Comparing the visibility curves for r modes with Fourier amplitude spectra of Kepler light curves of upper main-sequence B, A, and F stars, we find that r modes are present in many {$\gamma$} Dor stars (as first discovered by Van Reeth et al.), spotted stars, and so-called heartbeat stars, which are highly eccentric binary stars. We also find a signature of r modes in a frequently bursting Be star observed by Kepler. In the amplitude spectra of moderately to rapidly rotating {$\gamma$} Dor stars, r-mode frequency groups appear at lower frequency than prograde g-mode frequency groups, while in the amplitude spectra of spotted early A to B stars, groups of symmetric (with respect to the equator) r-mode frequencies appear just below the frequency of a structured peak that we suggest represents an approximate stellar rotation rate. In many heartbeat stars, a group of frequencies can be fitted with symmetric m = 1 r modes, which can be used to obtain rotation frequencies of these stars.},

The frequency shifts are observed to increase towards higher-order modes to reach a maximum of about 0.8 \textmu Hz over the 11-yr solar cycle. A comparable frequency dependence is also measured in two other main sequence solar-like stars, the F-star HD 49933, and the young 1 Gyr-old solar analog KIC 10644253, although with different amplitudes of the shifts of about 2 \textmu Hz and 0.5 \textmu Hz, respectively. Our objective here is to extend this analysis to stars with different masses, metallicities, and evolutionary stages. From an initial set of 87 Kepler solar-like oscillating stars with known individual p-mode frequencies, we identify five stars showing frequency shifts that can be considered reliable using selection criteria based on Monte Carlo simulations and on the photospheric magnetic activity proxy S ph. The frequency dependence of the frequency shifts of four of these stars could be measured for the l = 0 and l = 1 modes individually. Given the quality of the data, the results could indicate that a physical source of perturbation different from that in the Sun is dominating in this sample of solar-like stars.},

In agreement with previous studies, the youngest stars and fastest rotators in our sample are actually the most active. The activity of stars older than the Sun seems to not evolve much with age.

  abstract = {We determine ages of 71 old Open Clusters by a two-step method: we use main-squence fitting to 10 selected clusters, in order to obtain their distances, and derive their ages from comparison with our own isochrones used before for Globular Clusters. We then calibrate the morphological age indicator {$\delta$}(V), which can be obtained for all remaining clusters, in terms of age and metallicity. Particular care is taken to ensure consistency in the whole procedure. The resulting Open Cluster ages connect well to our previous Globular Cluster results. From the Open Cluster sample, as well as from the combined sample, questions regarding the formation process of Galactic components are addressed. The age of the oldest open clusters (NGC 6791 and Be 17) is of the order of 10 Gyr. We determine a delay by 2.0 {$\pm$} 1.5 Gyr between the start of the halo and thin disk formation, whereas thin and thick disk started to form approximately at the same time. We do not find any significant age\textendash metallicity relationship for the open cluster sample. The cumulative age distribution of the whole open cluster sample shows a moderately significant ({$\sim$}2{$\sigma$} level) departure from the predictions for an exponentially declining dissolution rate with timescale of 2.5 Gyr. The cumulative age distribution does not show any trend with galactocentric distance, but the clusters with larger height to the Galactic plane have an excess of objects between 2\textendash 4 and 6 Gyr with respect to their counterpart closer to the plane of the Galaxy.},

A parallel avenue of old star cluster research considers these objects as bench tests of low-mass stellar models. This short review will highlight some recent tests of stellar evolution models that make use of photometric and spectroscopic observations of resolved old star clusters. In some cases these tests have pointed to additional physical processes efficient in low-mass stars, that are not routinely included in model computations. Moreover, recent results from the \emph{Kepler{$<$}i/{$>$} mission about the old open cluster NGC6791 are adding new tight constraints to the models.}},

  abstract = {The {$\gamma$} Dor pulsating stars present high-order gravity modes, which make them important targets in the intermediate- and low-mass main-sequence region of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Whilst we have only access to rotation in the envelope of the Sun, the g modes of {$\gamma$} Dor stars can in principle deliver us constraints on the inner layers. With the puzzling discovery of unexpectedly low rotation rates in the core of red giants, the {$\gamma$} Dor stars appear now as unique targets to explore internal angular momentum transport in the progenitors of red giants. Yet, the {$\gamma$} Dor pulsations remain hard to detect from the ground for their periods are close to 1 day. While the CoRoT space mission first revealed intriguing frequency spectra, the almost uninterrupted 4-year photometry from the Kepler mission eventually shed a new light on them. It revealed regularities in the spectra, expected to bear signature of physical processes, including rotation, in the shear layers close to the convective core. We present here the first results of our effort to derive exploitable seismic diagnosis for mid- to fast rotators among {$\gamma$} Dor stars. We confirm their potential to explore the rotation history of this early phase of stellar evolution.},

  abstract = {We propose a method for calculating the radius of an open cluster in an objective way from an astrometric catalogue containing, at least, positions and proper motions. It uses the minimum spanning tree (hereinafter MST) in the proper motion space to discriminate cluster stars from field stars and it quantifies the strength of the cluster-field separation by means of a statistical parameter defined for the first time in this paper. This is done for a range of different sampling radii from where the cluster radius is obtained as the size at which the best cluster-field separation is achieved. The novelty of this strategy is that the cluster radius is obtained independently of how its stars are spatially distributed. We test the reliability and robustness of the method with both simulated and real data from a well-studied open cluster (NGC 188), and apply it to UCAC4 data for five other open clusters with different catalogued radius values. NGC 188, NGC 1647, NGC 6603 and Ruprecht 155 yielded unambiguous radius values of 15.2+/-1.8, 29.4+/-3.4, 4.2+/-1.7 and 7.0+/-0.3 arcmin, respectively. ASCC 19 and Collinder 471 showed more than one possible solution but it is not possible to know whether this is due to the involved uncertainties or to the presence of complex patterns in their proper motion distributions, something that could be inherent to the physical object or due to the way in which the catalogue was sampled.},

Evidence shows that the period-color and period-luminosity (P-L) relations for population I Cepheids in the Galaxy and in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds have different slopes and zero points. This greatly complicates use of Cepheids for the extragalactic distance scale. Strategies are discussed to patch the problem. A consensus exists for the long distance scale for RR Lyrae stars whose calibrations favor {$\langle$}MV(RR){$\rangle$} = 0.52 at [Fe/H] = -1.5. Exceptions exist for ``second parameter'' clusters where the variation of the morphology of the horizontal branch with metallicity is anomalous, the most blatant being NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. The status and calibrations of ABH1 and AC show that different evolutionary paths and masses explain the difference P-L relations for them. AC appear predominantly in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies, but are almost absent in Galactic globular clusters. AHB1 stars are absent in dwarf spheroidals but are present in globular clusters. The difference may be used to study the formation of the remote Galactic halo if it is partially made by tidal disruption of companion dwarf spheroidals.},

Furthermore, we provide posterior extinction estimates (\$A\_V\$) to every star using published extinction maps as a prior input. We provide an appendix with extinction coefficients for Gaia photometry derived from stellar models, which account for variation with intrinsic colour and total extinction. Our pipeline provides output estimates of the spectroscopic parameters, which can be used to inform improved spectroscopic analysis. We complement our catalogues with Galactocentric coordinates and actions with associated uncertainties. As a demonstration of the power of our catalogue, we produce velocity dispersion profiles of the disc separated by age and Galactocentric radius (between \$3\$ and \$15\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{kpc\}\$ from the Galactic centre). This suggests that the velocity dispersion profiles flatten with radius in the outer Galaxy (\${$>$}8\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{kpc\}\$) and that at all radii the velocity dispersion follows the smooth power law with age observed in the solar neighbourhood.},

The component masses are 1.603 {$\pm$} 0.006(stat.) {$\pm$} 0.016(sys.) and 1.419 {$\pm$} 0.003 {$\pm$} 0.008 , and the radii are 1.744 {$\pm$} 0.004 {$\pm$} 0.002 and 1.544 {$\pm$} 0.002 {$\pm$} 0.002 . The isochrone ages of the stars are mildly inconsistent: the age from the mass\textendash radius combination for the primary (1.05 {$\pm$} 0.05 {$\pm$} 0.09 Gyr, where the last quote was systematic uncertainty from models and metallicity) is smaller than that from the secondary (1.21 {$\pm$} 0.05 {$\pm$} 0.15 Gyr) and is consistent with the inference from the color\textendash magnitude diagram (1.00 {$\pm$} 0.05 Gyr). We have improved the measurements of the asteroseismic parameters {$\Delta\nu$} and {$\nu$} max for helium-burning stars in the cluster. The masses of the stars appear to be larger (or alternately, the radii appear to be smaller) than predicted from isochrones using the ages derived from the eclipsing stars.

We used the period\textendash luminosity relation for high-amplitude {$\delta$} Sct stars to fit the ensemble of the strongest frequencies for the cluster members, finding .

Using Kepler K2 and ground-based photometry, along with a large set of new and reanalyzed spectra, we derived highly precise masses (1.111{$\pm$}0.015 and 0.748{$\pm$}0.005 Me) and radii (1.071{$\pm$}0.008{$\pm$}0.003 and 0.713{$\pm$}0.019{$\pm$}0.026 Re, with statistical and systematic error estimates) for the stars. The radius of the secondary star is in agreement with theory. The primary, however, is approximately 15\% smaller than reasonable isochrones for the cluster predict. Our best explanation is that the primary star was produced from the merger of two stars, as this can also account for the nondetection of photospheric lithium and its higher temperature relative to other cluster main-sequence stars at the same V magnitude. To understand the dynamical characteristics (low measured rotational line broadening of the primary star and low eccentricity of the current binary orbit), we believe that the most probable (but not the only) explanation is the tidal evolution of a close binary within a primordial triple system (possibly after a period of Kozai\textendash Lidov oscillations), leading to merger approximately 1 Gyr ago. This star appears to be a future blue straggler that is being revealed as the cluster ages and the most massive main-sequence stars die out.},

These frequency variations are expected to be common in solar-type stars and contain information about the activity-related changes that take place in their interiors. The unprecedented duration of Kepler photometric timeseries provides a unique opportunity to detect and characterize stellar magnetic cycles through asteroseismology. In this work, we analyze a sample of 87 solar-type stars, measuring their temporal frequency shifts over segments of 90 days. For each segment, the individual frequencies are obtained through a Bayesian peak-bagging tool. The mean frequency shifts are then computed and compared with: (1) those obtained from a cross-correlation method; (2) the variation in the mode heights; (3) a photometric activity proxy; and (4) the characteristic timescale of the granulation. For each star and 90-day sub-series, we provide mean frequency shifts, mode heights, and characteristic timescales of the granulation. Interestingly, more than 60\% of the stars show evidence for (quasi-) periodic variations in the frequency shifts. In the majority of the cases, these variations are accompanied by variations in other activity proxies. About 20\% of the stars show mode frequencies and heights varying approximately in phase, in opposition to what is observed for the Sun.},

Also, small old clusters are preferentially found close to the Galactic plane, whereas larger ones more frequently live farther away from the plane and at larger Galactocentric distances. For clusters with , a clear dependence of the apparent radius on age has been detected: the cluster radii decrease by a factor of about 2 from an age of 10 Myr to an age of 1 Gyr. A detailed analysis shows that this observed effect can be explained by mass segregation and does not necessarily reflect a real decrease of cluster radii. We found evidence for the latter for the majority of clusters older than 30 Myr. Among the youngest clusters (between 5 and 30 Myr), there are some clusters with a significant grade of mass segregation, whereas some others show no segregation at all. At a cluster age between 50 and 100 Myr, the distribution of stars of different masses becomes more regular over cluster area. In older clusters the evolution of the massive stars is the most prominent effect we observe.}}}},

Two of the secondary sources are likely foreground objects, while the remaining six are background sources; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that three of the objects may be physically associated. We measured a range of i{${'}$}-band amplitude dilutions for the candidate companion systems from 0.43\% to 15.4\%.

Formulae are obtained for the contribution of every star into the spatial density profile. The evaluation of spatial density profiles is tested against open-cluster models from N-body experiments with N = 500. Surface density profiles are derived for seven open clusters (NGC 1502, 1960, 2287, 2516, 2682, 6819 and 6939) using Two-Micron All-Sky Survey data and for different limiting magnitudes. The selection of an optimal kernel half-width is discussed. It is shown that open-cluster radius estimates hardly depend on the kernel half-width. Hints of stellar mass segregation and structural features indicating cluster non-stationarity in the regular force field are found. A comparison with other investigations shows that the data on open-cluster sizes are often underestimated. The existence of an extended corona around the open cluster NGC 6939 was confirmed. A combined function composed of the King density profile for the cluster core and the uniform sphere for the cluster corona is shown to be a better approximation of the surface radial density profile.The King function alone does not reproduce surface density profiles of sample clusters properly. The number of stars, the cluster masses and the tidal radii in the Galactic gravitational field for the sample clusters are estimated. It is shown that NGC 6819 and 6939 are extended beyond their tidal surfaces.},

  abstract = {We present here a fast code for creating a synthetic survey of the Milky Way. Given one or more color-magnitude bounds, a survey size, and geometry, the code returns a catalog of stars in accordance with a given model of the Milky Way. The model can be specified by a set of density distributions or as an N-body realization. We provide fast and efficient algorithms for sampling both types of models. As compared to earlier sampling schemes which generate stars at specified locations along a line of sight, our scheme can generate a continuous and smooth distribution of stars over any given volume. The code is quite general and flexible and can accept input in the form of a star formation rate, age-metallicity relation, age-velocity-dispersion relation, and analytic density distribution functions. Theoretical isochrones are then used to generate a catalog of stars, and support is available for a wide range of photometric bands. As a concrete example, we implement the Besan\c{c}on Milky Way model for the disk. For the stellar halo we employ the simulated stellar halo N-body models of Bullock \& Johnston. In order to sample N-body models, we present a scheme that disperses the stars spawned by an N-body particle, in such a way that the phase-space density of the spawned stars is consistent with that of the N-body particles. The code is ideally suited to generating synthetic data sets that mimic near future wide area surveys such as GAIA, LSST, and HERMES. As an application we study the prospect of identifying structures in the stellar halo with a simulated GAIA survey. We plan to make the code publicly available.},

This provides a promising opportunity to study the Galactic structure and evolution. We use asteroseismic data of red giants, observed by Kepler, to test the current theoretical framework of modeling the Galaxy based on population synthesis modeling and the use of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants. We use the open source code Galaxia to model the Milky Way and find the distribution of the masses predicted by Galaxia to be systematically offset with respect to the seismically inferred observed masses. The Galactic model overestimates the number of low-mass stars, and these stars are predominantly old and of low metallicity. Using corrections to the Dn scaling relation suggested by stellar models significantly reduces the disagreement between predicted and observed masses. For a few cases where non-seismic mass estimates are available, the corrections to Dn also improve the agreement between seismic and non-seismic mass estimates. The disagreement between predictions of the Galactic model and the observations is most pronounced for stars with [Fe/H] {$<$} -0.5 and [Fe/H] {$>$} 0 or for Teff {$>$} 4700 K. Altering the star formation rate in order to suppress stars older than 10 Gyr improves the agreement for mass but leads to inconsistent color distributions. We also tested the predictions of the TRILEGAL Galactic model. However, unlike Galaxia, it had difficulties in reproducing the photometric properties of the Kepler Input Catalog because it overestimates the number of blue stars. We conclude that either the scaling relations and/or the Galactic models need to be revised to reconcile predictions of theory with asteroseismic observations.},

Here, we revisit the analysis of the asteroseismic sample of dwarf and subgiant stars observed by Kepler and investigate in detail the possible causes for the reported discrepancy. We investigate two models of the Milky Way based on stellar population synthesis, Galaxia and TRILEGAL. In agreement with previous results, we find that TRILEGAL predicts more massive stars compared to Galaxia, and that TRILEGAL predicts too many blue stars compared to 2MASS observations. Both models fail to match the distribution of the stellar sample in (log g, Teff) space, pointing to inaccuracies in the models and/or the assumed selection function. When corrected for this mismatch in (log g, Teff) space, the mass distribution calculated by Galaxia is broader and the mean is shifted toward lower masses compared to that of the observed stars. This behavior is similar to what has been reported for the Kepler red giant sample. The shift between the mass distributions is equivalent to a change of 2\% in {$\nu$}max, which is within the current uncertainty in the {$\nu$}max scaling relation. Applying corrections to the {$\Delta\nu$} scaling relation predicted by the stellar models makes the observed mass distribution significantly narrower, but there is no change to the mean.},

  abstract = {Some pulsating stars are good clocks. When they are found in binary stars, the frequencies of their luminosity variations are modulated by the Doppler effect caused by orbital motion. For each pulsation frequency this manifests itself as a multiplet separated by the orbital frequency in the Fourier transform of the light curve of the star. We derive the theoretical relations to exploit data from the Fourier transform to derive all the parameters of a binary system traditionally extracted from spectroscopic radial velocities, including the mass function which is easily derived from the amplitude ratio of the first orbital sidelobes to the central frequency for each pulsation frequency. This is a new technique that yields radial velocities from the Doppler shift of a pulsation frequency, thus eliminates the need to obtain spectra. For binary stars with pulsating components, an orbital solution can be obtained from the light curve alone. We give a complete derivation of this and demonstrate it both with artificial data, and with a case of a hierarchical eclipsing binary with Kepler mission data, KIC 4150611 (HD 181469). We show that it is possible to detect Jupiter-mass planets orbiting {$\delta$} Sct and other pulsating stars with our technique. We also show how to distinguish orbital frequency multiplets from potentially similar non-radial m-mode multiplets and from oblique pulsation multiplets.},

While mCP stars typically exhibit rotation periods that are significantly longer than those of non-mCP stars, both populations exhibit typical periods \$\textbackslash lesssim10\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm d\}\$; therefore, the early \textbackslash emph\{TESS\} releases are suitable for searching for rotational modulation of the light curves of both mCP and non-mCP stars. We present the results of our search for A-type stars that exhibit variability in their \textbackslash emph\{TESS\} light curves that is consistent with rotational modulation based on the first two data releases obtained from sectors 1 to 4. Our search yielded \$134\$ high-probability candidate rotational variables -- \$60\$ of which have not been previously reported. Approximately half of these stars are identified in the literature as Ap (mCP) stars. Comparisons between the subsample of high-probability candidate rotationally variable Ap stars and the subsample of stars that are not identified as Ap reveal that the latter subsample exhibits statistically (i) shorter rotation periods and (ii) significantly lower photometric amplitudes.},

  abstract = {We present a study of 33 Kepler planet-candidate host stars for which asteroseismic observations have sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio to allow extraction of individual pulsation frequencies. We implement a new Bayesian scheme that is flexible in its input to process individual oscillation frequencies, combinations of them, and average asteroseismic parameters, and derive robust fundamental properties for these targets. Applying this scheme to grids of evolutionary models yields stellar properties with median statistical uncertainties of 1.2 per cent (radius), 1.7 per cent (density), 3.3 per cent (mass), 4.4 per cent (distance), and 14 per cent (age), making this the exoplanet host-star sample with the most precise and uniformly determined fundamental parameters to date. We assess the systematics from changes in the solar abundances and mixing-length parameter, showing that they are smaller than the statistical errors. We also determine the stellar properties with three other fitting algorithms and explore the systematics arising from using different evolution and pulsation codes, resulting in 1 per cent in density and radius, and 2 per cent and 7 per cent in mass and age, respectively. We confirm previous findings of the initial helium abundance being a source of systematics comparable to our statistical uncertainties, and discuss future prospects for constraining this parameter by combining asteroseismology and data from space missions. Finally, we compare our derived properties with those obtained using the global average asteroseismic observables along with effective temperature and metallicity, finding excellent level of agreement. Owing to selection effects, our results show that the majority of the high signal-to-noise ratio asteroseismic Kepler host stars are older than the Sun.},

  abstract = {Investigations of the origin and evolution of the Milky Way disc have long relied on chemical and kinematic identifications of its components to reconstruct our Galactic past. Difficulties in determining precise stellar ages have restricted most studies to small samples, normally confined to the solar neighbourhood. Here, we break this impasse with the help of asteroseismic inference and perform a chronology of the evolution of the disc throughout the age of the Galaxy. We chemically dissect the Milky Way disc population using a sample of red giant stars spanning out to 2 kpc in the solar annulus observed by the Kepler satellite, with the added dimension of asteroseismic ages. Our results reveal a clear difference in age between the low- and high-{$\alpha$} populations, which also show distinct velocity dispersions in the V and W components. We find no tight correlation between age and metallicity nor [{$\alpha$}/Fe] for the high-{$\alpha$} disc stars. Our results indicate that this component formed over a period of more than 2 Gyr with a wide range of [M/H] and [{$\alpha$}/Fe] independent of time. Our findings show that the kinematic properties of young {$\alpha$}-rich stars are consistent with the rest of the high-{$\alpha$} population and different from the low-{$\alpha$} stars of similar age, rendering support to their origin being old stars that went through a mass transfer or stellar merger event, making them appear younger, instead of migration of truly young stars formed close to the Galactic bar.},

From the time-series photometry, the two seismic parameters that can be most readily extracted are the large frequency separation ({$\Delta\nu$}) and the frequency of maximum oscillation power ({$\nu$}max). After the survey phase, these quantities are available for hundreds of solar-type stars. By scaling from solar values, we use these two asteroseismic observables to identify for the first time an evolutionary sequence of 1 M field stars, without the need for further information from stellar models. Comparison of our determinations with the few available spectroscopic results shows an excellent level of agreement.

In a slightly less massive target the presence of a convective core cannot be conclusively discarded, and thus its remaining main-sequence lifetime is uncertain. Our results reveal that best-fit models found solely by matching individual frequencies of oscillations corrected for surface effects do not always properly reproduce frequency combinations. Moreover, slightly different criteria to define what the best-fit model is can lead to solutions with similar global properties but very different interior structures. We argue that the use of frequency ratios is a more reliable way to obtain accurate stellar parameters, and show that our analysis in field main-sequence stars can yield an overall precision of 1.5\%, 4\%, and 10\% in radius, mass, and age, respectively. We compare our results with those obtained from global oscillation properties, and discuss the possible sources of uncertainties in asteroseismic stellar modeling where further studies are still needed.},

  abstract = {Accurately determining the properties of stars is of prime importance for characterizing stellar populations in our Galaxy. The field of asteroseismology has been thought to be particularly successful in such an endeavor for stars in different evolutionary stages. However, to fully exploit its potential, robust methods for estimating stellar parameters are required and independent verification of the results is mandatory. With this purpose, we present a new technique to obtain stellar properties by coupling asteroseismic analysis with the InfraRed Flux Method. By using two global seismic observables and multi-band photometry, the technique allows us to obtain masses, radii, effective temperatures, bolometric fluxes, and hence distances for field stars in a self-consistent manner. We apply our method to 22 solar-like oscillators in the Kepler short-cadence sample, that have accurate Hipparcos parallaxes. Our distance determinations agree to better than 5\%, while measurements of spectroscopic effective temperatures and interferometric radii also validate our results. We briefly discuss the potential of our technique for stellar population analysis and models of Galactic Chemical Evolution.},

We analyze 11 months of 1 minute cadence data from Kepler, presenting Kepler flare frequency distributions, as well as determining correlations between flare energy, amplitude, duration, and decay time. We find that the exponent {$\alpha$} of the power-law flare energy distribution varies in time, primarily due to completeness of sample and the low frequency of high-energy flares. We also find a deviation from a single power law at high energy. We use ground-based spectroscopic observations that were simultaneous with the Kepler data to provide simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic analysis of three low-energy flares, the lowest-energy dMe flares with detailed spectral analysis to date on any star. The spectroscopic data from these flares extend constraints for radiative hydrodynamic flare models to a lower energy regime than has previously been studied. We use this simultaneous spectroscopy and Kepler photometry to develop approximate conversions from the Kepler bandpass to the traditional U and B bands. This conversion will be a critical factor in comparing any Kepler flare analyses to the canon of previous ground-based flare studies.},

In addition to tens of pulsation frequencies in the g-mode domain, its Fourier spectrum shows three weak peaks at very low frequencies, which is too low to be explained in terms of g modes. The most convincing explanation is that we are seeing the orbital modulation of three Earth-size planets (or planetary remnants) in very tight orbits, which are illuminated by the strong stellar radiation. The orbital periods are P1 = 5.273, P2 = 7.807, and P3 = 19.48 h, and the period ratios P2/P1 = 1.481 and P3/P2 = 2.495 are very close to the 3:2 and 5:2 resonances, respectively. One of the main pulsation modes of the star at 210.68 \textmu Hz corresponds to the third harmonic of the orbital frequency of the inner planet, suggesting that we see, for the first time in an sdB star, g-mode pulsations tidally excited by a planetary companion. The extreme planetary system that emerges from the Kepler data is very similar to the recent discovery of two Earth-size planets orbiting the sdB pulsator KIC 05807616 (Charpinet et al. 2011a).},

We determine the centre of gravity (\$C\_\{grav\}\$) and construct the projected density profile of the cluster using the probable cluster members selected from HST and Gaia DR2 proper motion data sets. The projected density profile in the investigated region is nicely reproduced by a single mass King model, with core (\$r\_\{c\}\$) and tidal (\$r\_\{t\}\$) radius as \$75\^\{\textbackslash prime\textbackslash prime\}.2\$ \$\textbackslash pm\$ \$3\^\{\textbackslash prime\textbackslash prime\}.1\$ and \$35\^\{\textbackslash prime\}.6\$ \$\textbackslash pm\$ \$1\^\{\textbackslash prime\}.1\$ respectively. In total, 90 BSSs are identified on the basis of proper motion data in the region of radius \$625\^\{\textbackslash prime\textbackslash prime\}\$. An average mass of the BSSs is determined as \$1.06\$ \$\textbackslash pm\$ \$0.09\$ \$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ and with an age range of 0.5 to 7 Gyrs. The BSS radial distribution shows a bimodal trend, with a peak in the centre, a minimum at \$r \textbackslash sim r\_c\$ and a rising tendency in the outer region. The BSS radial distribution shows a flat behaviour in the outermost region of the cluster. We also estimate \$A\^\{+\}\_\{rh\}\$ parameter as an alternative indicator of the dynamical status of the cluster and is found to be \$0.038\$ \$\textbackslash pm\$ \$0.016\$.

  abstract = {A spectroscopic analysis of stellar spectra can be carried out using different approaches; different methods, line lists, atomic parameters, solar abundances etc. The resulting atmospheric parameters from these choices can vary beyond quoted uncertainties in the literature. Here we characterize these differences by systematically comparing some of the commonly adopted ingredients; line lists, equivalent width measurements and atomic parameters. High resolution and high signal-to-noise spectroscopic data of one helium-core-burning red giant star in each of the three open clusters, NGC6819, M67 and NGC188 have been obtained with the FIES spectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope. The M67 target has been used to benchmark the analysis, as it is a well studied cluster with asteroseismic data from the K2 mission. For the other two clusters we have obtained higher quality data than previously analyzed, which allows us to establish their chemical composition more securely.

  abstract = {A spectroscopic analysis of stellar spectra can be carried out using different approaches; different methods, line lists, atomic parameters, solar abundances etc. The resulting atmospheric parameters from these choices can vary beyond quoted uncertainties in the literature. Here we characterize these differences by systematically comparing some of the commonly adopted ingredients; line lists, equivalent width measurements and atomic parameters. High resolution and high signal-to-noise spectroscopic data of one helium-core-burning red giant star in each of the three open clusters, NGC6819, M67 and NGC188 have been obtained with the FIES spectrograph at the Nordic Optical Telescope. The M67 target has been used to benchmark the analysis, as it is a well studied cluster with asteroseismic data from the K2 mission. For the other two clusters we have obtained higher quality data than previously analyzed, which allows us to establish their chemical composition more securely. Using a line by line analysis, we tested several different combinations of line lists and programs to measure equivalent widths of absorption lines to characterize systematic differences within the same spectroscopic method. The obtained parameters for the benchmark star in M67 vary up to \textasciitilde 170 K in T\_eff, \textasciitilde 0.4 dex in log g and \textasciitilde 0.25 dex in [Fe/H] between the tested setups.

  abstract = {Aims: Previously [Y/Mg] has been proven to be an age indicator for solar twins. Here, we investigate if this relation also holds for helium-core-burning stars of solar metallicity. Methods: High resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectroscopic data of stars in the helium-core-burning phase have been obtained with the FIES spectrograph on the NOT 2.56 m telescope and the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck I 10 m telescope. They have been analyzed to determine the chemical abundances of four open clusters with close to solar metallicity; NGC 6811, NGC 6819, M 67 and NGC 188. The abundances are derived from equivalent widths of spectral lines using ATLAS9 model atmospheres with parameters determined from the excitation and ionization balance of Fe lines. Results from asteroseismology and binary studies were used as priors on the atmospheric parameters, where especially the log g is determined to much higher precision than what is possible with spectroscopy. Results: It is confirmed that the four open clusters are close to solar metallicity and they follow the [Y/Mg] vs. age trend previously found for solar twins.  Conclusions: The [Y/Mg] vs. age clock also works for giant stars in the helium-core burning phase, which vastly increases the possibilities to estimate the age of stars not only in the solar neighborhood, but in large parts of the Galaxy, due to the brighter nature of evolved stars compared to dwarfs. Based on spectroscopic observations made with two telescopes: the Nordic Optical Telescope operated by NOTSA at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos (La Palma, Spain) of the Instituto de Astrof\'isica de Canarias and the Keck I Telescope at the W.M. Keck Observatory (Mauna Kea, Hawaii, USA) operated by the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.},

  abstract = {Stars observed in the field of an open cluster are ideal for a controlled test of chemical tagging. Using chemical tagging, one should identify the cluster members, i.e., those stars of similar chemical composition, if their composition is indeed different from that of all the nonmember stars of the field. Moreover, the abundance-based membership can be checked against membership based on radial velocities and proper motions. Here, I report preliminary results of such an experiment using data from the Gaia-ESO Survey. Although the three membership criteria usually agree, a few interesting examples of discrepant membership classification have been found. In addition, the mean composition of each open cluster was compared to a sample of 1 600 Gaia-ESO field stars. Some cases of field stars with abundances matching those of the open clusters were identified. This experiment suggests that open clusters do not necessarily have unique abundance patterns that set them apart from all other clusters.},

  abstract = {With the unprecedented photometric precision of the Kepler spacecraft,  significant systematic and stochastic errors on transit signal levels are observable in the Kepler photometric data. These errors, which include discontinuities, outliers, systematic trends, and other instrumental signatures, obscure astrophysical signals. The presearch data conditioning (PDC) module of the Kepler data analysis pipeline tries to remove these errors while preserving planet transits and other astrophysically interesting signals. The completely new noise and stellar variability regime observed in Kepler data poses a significant problem to standard cotrending methods. Variable stars are often of particular astrophysical interest, so the preservation of their signals is of significant importance to the astrophysical community. We present a Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach, where a subset of highly correlated and quiet stars is used to generate a cotrending basis vector set, which is in turn used to establish a range of ``reasonable'' robust fit parameters. These robust fit parameters are then used to generate a Bayesian prior and a Bayesian posterior probability distribution function (PDF) which, when maximized, finds the best fit that simultaneously removes systematic effects while reducing the signal distortion and noise injection that commonly afflicts simple least-squares (LS) fitting. A numerical and empirical approach is taken where the Bayesian prior PDFs are generated from fits to the light-curve distributions themselves.},

This review presents a summary of the available techniques for age-dating stars and ensembles of stars, their realms of applicability, and their strengths and weaknesses. My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is described. Although our present ability to determine the ages of even the nearest stars is mediocre, the next few years hold great promise as asteroseismology probes beyond stellar surfaces and starts to provide precise interior properties of stars and as models continue to improve when stressed by better observations.},

A frequency analysis of the eclipse-subtracted light curve reveals at least 68 frequencies, of which 55 or more can be attributed to pulsation modes. The main limitation on this analysis is the frequency resolution within the 27-d short-cadence light curve. Most of the variability signal lies in the frequency range 18\textendash 31 d-1, with amplitudes between 0.1 and 4 mmag. One harmonic term (2f ) and a few combination frequencies (fi + fj) have been detected. From a plot of the residuals versus orbital phase, we assign the pulsations to the primary star in the system. The pulsations were removed from the short-cadence data and the light curve was modelled using the Wilson\textendash Devinney code. We are unable to get a perfect fit due to the residual effects of pulsations and also to the treatment of reflection and reprocessing in the light-curve model. A model where the secondary star fills its Roche lobe is favoured, which means that KIC 10661783 can be classified as an oEA system. Further photometric and spectroscopic observations will allow the masses and radii of the two stars to be measured to high precision and hundreds of {$\delta$} Scuti pulsation frequencies to be resolved. This could lead to unique constraints on theoretical models of {$\delta$} Scuti stars, if the evolutionary history of KIC 10661783 can be accounted for.},

Since these stars are important for the stellar evolution theory, we performed a search for blue stars in the vicinity of the open cluster NGC 6791, which was observed by the Kepler in the long cadence mode in the so-called super apertures. We used Q1-Q17 LC data and performed pixel analysis using PyKE and our customized scripts. We preliminary tagged 23 objects and we calculated amplitude spectra to look for periodic signal which exist in the data. We found four stars with significant signal in the amplitude spectra with none of them classified as gravity modes in pulsating hot subdwarfs. Likely, all four objects are binaries, though, spectroscopic observations are needed to sort out our hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Solar-like stars (M \&lt; 1.3 Msun) lose angular momentum through their magnetized winds. The resulting evolution of the surface rotation period, which can be directly measured photometrically, has the potential to provide an accurate indicator of stellar age, and is constrained by observations of rotation periods of coeval stars, such as members of Galactic open clusters. A prominent observational feature of the mass-rotation period diagrams of open clusters is a sequence of relatively slower rotators. The formation and persistence of this slow rotators sequence across several billion years imply an approximately coherent spin-down of the stars that belong to it. In particular, the sequence is observed to evolve coherently towards longer periods in progressively older clusters. Recent observations of the 700-Myr old Praesepe and the 1-Gyr old NGC 6811 clusters, however, seem to contradict this general pattern. While the 1 Msun stars on the slow rotators sequence of the older NGC 6811 have longer periods than their counterparts in the younger Praesepe, as expected, the two sequences essentially merge at lower masses (\&lt; 0.8 Msun). In other words, low-mass stars seem to have not been spinning down at all in the intervening 300 Myr. Here we show that this behavior is a manifestation of the variable rotational coupling in solar-like stars. The resurfacing of angular momentum from the interior can temporarily compensate for the loss due to wind braking at the surface. The internal redistribution of angular momentum has a steep mass dependence; as a result, the re-coupling occurs at different ages for stars of different masses. Our model explains the stalled surface spin-down of low-mass stars between Praesepe and NGC 6811, and predicts that the same behavior should be observable at other ages in other mass ranges.},

  abstract = {We present models of the components of the systems KOI-126 and CM Draconis, the two eclipsing binary systems known to date to contain stars with masses low enough to have fully convective interiors. We are able to model satisfactorily the system KOI-126, finding consistent solutions for the radii and surface temperatures of all three components, using a solar-like value of the mixing-length parameter {$\alpha$} in the convection zone and PHOENIX NextGen 1D model atmospheres for the surface boundary conditions. Depending on the chemical composition, we estimate the age of the system to be in the range 3\textendash 5 Gyr. For CM Draconis, on the other hand, we cannot reconcile our models with the observed radii and Teff using the current metal-poor composition estimate based on kinematics. Higher metallicities lessen but do not remove the discrepancy. We then explore the effect of varying the mixing-length parameter {$\alpha$}. As previously noted in the literature, a reduced {$\alpha$} can be used as a simple measure of the lower convective efficiency due to rotation and induced magnetic fields. Our models show a sensitivity to {$\alpha$} (for {$\alpha$} {$<$} 1.0) sufficient to partially account for the radius discrepancies. It is, however, impossible to reconcile the models with the observations on the basis of the effect of the reduced {$\alpha$} alone. We therefore suggest that the combined effects of high metallicity and {$\alpha$} reduction could explain the observations of CM Draconis. For example, increasing the metallicity of the system towards super-solar values (i.e. Z = 2 Z ) yields an agreement within 2{$\sigma$} with {$\alpha$} = 1.0.},

An unprobed assumption of this field is that the chemical composition of a star is an immutable marker of the gas from which it formed. It is vital to test this assumption on open clusters, group of stars formed from the same gas. Previous investigations have shown that unevolved stars in clusters are chemically homogeneous within the typical uncertainties of these analysis, i.e. 15\$\textbackslash\%\$ of the elemental abundances. Our strictly differential analysis on five members of the Pleiades allows us to reach precisions of 5\$\textbackslash\%\$ for most elements and to unveil chemical anomalies within the cluster that could be explained by planet engulfment events. These results reveal that the evolution of planetary systems may alter the chemical composition of stars, challenging our capability of tagging them to their native environments, and also paving the way for the study of planetary architectures and their evolution, through the chemical pattern of their host stars.},

  abstract = {Scaling relations that link asteroseismic quantities to global stellar properties are important for gaining understanding of the intricate physics that underpins stellar pulsations. The common notion that all stars in an open cluster have essentially the same distance, age, and initial composition implies that the stellar parameters can be measured to much higher precision than what is usually achievable for single stars. This makes clusters ideal for exploring the relation between the mode amplitude of solar-like oscillations and the global stellar properties. We have analyzed data obtained with NASA's Kepler space telescope to study solar-like oscillations in 100 red giant stars located in either of the three open clusters, NGC 6791, NGC 6819, and NGC 6811. By fitting the measured amplitudes to predictions from simple scaling relations that depend on luminosity, mass, and effective temperature, we find that the data cannot be described by any power of the luminosity-to-mass ratio as previously assumed. As a result we provide a new improved empirical relation which treats luminosity and mass separately. This relation turns out to also work remarkably well for main-sequence and subgiant stars. In addition, the measured amplitudes reveal the potential presence of a number of previously unknown unresolved binaries in the red clump in NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, pointing to an interesting new application for asteroseismology as a probe into the formation history of open clusters.},

Techniques for determining cluster membership therefore play a key role in the investigation of clusters.

Due to their high scientific value, in particular for Galaxy population studies and stellar structure and evolution, their Kepler light curves were made public in late 2011. More than 13,000 (over 85\%) of these stars show intrinsic flux variability caused by solar-like oscillations making them ideal for large-scale asteroseismic investigations. We automatically extracted individual frequencies and measured the period spacings of the dipole modes in nearly every red giant. These measurements naturally classify the stars into various populations, such as the red giant branch, the low-mass (M/M 1.8) helium-core-burning red clump, and the higher-mass (M/M 1.8) secondary clump. The period spacings also reveal that a large fraction of the stars show rotationally induced frequency splittings. This sample of stars will undoubtedly provide an extremely valuable source for studying the stellar population in the direction of the Kepler field, in particular when combined with complementary spectroscopic surveys.},

However, any asteroseismic inference has so far remained elusive due to the difficulty in measuring these extremely low-amplitude oscillations.

For stars like the Sun this is relatively easy because the mode frequencies follow a regular pattern described by a well-founded asymptotic relation. When a solar-like star evolves off the main sequence and onto the red giant branch its structure changes dramatically, resulting in changes in the frequency pattern of the modes. We follow the evolution of the adiabatic frequency pattern from the main sequence to near the tip of the red giant branch for a series of models. We find a significant departure from the asymptotic relation for the non-radial modes near the red giant branch tip, resulting in a triplet frequency pattern. To support our investigation we analyze almost four years of Kepler data of the most luminous stars in the field (late K and early M type) and find that their frequency spectra indeed show a triplet pattern dominated by dipole modes even for the most luminous stars in our sample. Our identification explains previous results from ground-based observations reporting fine structure in the Petersen diagram and sub-ridges in the period\textendash luminosity diagram. Finally, we find ``new ridges'' of non-radial modes with frequencies below the fundamental mode in our model calculations, and we speculate they are related to f modes.},

Traditionally,  stellar masses of single field stars are determined by comparing their location in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with stellar evolutionary models. Applying an additional method to determine the mass is therefore of significant interest for understanding stellar evolution. We present the time series analysis of 11 K giants recently observed with the WIRE satellite. With this comprehensive sample, we report the first confirmation that the characteristic acoustic frequency, {$\nu$}max, can be predicted for K giants by scaling from the solar acoustic cutoff frequency. We are further able to utilize our measurements of {$\nu$}max to determine an asteroseismic mass for each star with a lower uncertainty compared to the traditional method, for most stars in our sample. This indicates good prospects for the application of our method on the vast amounts of data that will soon come from the COROT and Kepler space missions.},

A fundamental facet of the theory is that nearly all the mode energy leaking into the core is trapped by the magnetic greenhouse effect. This results in clear predictions for how the mode visibility changes as a star evolves up the red giant branch, and how that depends on stellar mass, spherical degree, and mode lifetime. Here, we investigate the validity of these predictions with a focus on the visibility of different spherical degrees. We find that mode suppression weakens for higher degree modes with a reduction in the quadrupole mode visibility of up to 49\%, and no detectable suppression of octupole modes, in agreement with theory. We find evidence for the influence of increasing mode lifetimes on the visibilities along the red giant branch, in agreement with previous independent observations. These results support the theory that strong internal magnetic fields cause suppression of non-radial modes in red giants. We also find preliminary evidence that stars with suppressed dipole modes on average have slightly lower metallicity than normal stars.},

We discuss in detail the transformation of the instrumental magnitudes to the standard photometric system of Landolt and then discuss methods for selecting a subset of cluster stars whose photometric indices are most likely to be of high reliability. Color-magnitude and color-color diagrams for the cluster are presented and discussed. A detailed comparison of this photometry with the results of previous observational studies is presented. We make preliminary comparisons with theoretical isochrones provided by D. A. VandenBerg and conclude that an excellent match can be achieved if the metal abundance and age of the cluster are both near the upper end of the range of recent estimates ([Fe/H]\textasciitilde +0.3, age\textasciitilde 12 Gyr) and the reddening and true distance modulus are both near the low end of the range of recent estimates [E(B-V)\textasciitilde 0.09 mag and (m-M)0\textasciitilde 12.79 mag] if the isochrone predictions are reliable. A companion paper will discuss candidate variable stars and stars possibly showing planetary transits. Data tables listing measured magnitudes and standard errors, image-quality indices, a variability index, and equinox J2000.0 equatorial coordinates for 14,342 stars to V\textasciitilde 24 have been made available to the public through the services of the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.

  abstract = {Kepler provides light curves of 156,000 stars with unprecedented precision. However, the raw data as they come from the spacecraft contain significant systematic and stochastic errors. These errors, which include discontinuities, systematic trends, and outliers, obscure the astrophysical signals in the light curves. To correct these errors is the task of the Presearch Data Conditioning (PDC) module of the Kepler data analysis pipeline. The original version of PDC in Kepler did not meet the extremely high performance requirements for the detection of miniscule planet transits or highly accurate analysis of stellar activity and rotation. One particular deficiency was that astrophysical features were often removed as a side effect of the removal of errors. In this article we introduce the completely new and significantly improved version of PDC which was implemented in Kepler SOC version 8.0. This new PDC version, which utilizes a Bayesian approach for removal of systematics, reliably corrects errors in the light curves while at the same time preserving planet transits and other astrophysically interesting signals. We describe the architecture and the algorithms of this new PDC module, show typical errors encountered in Kepler data, and illustrate the corrections using real light curve examples.},

To further minimize the number of targets for which PDC-MAP fails to perform admirably, we have developed a new method, called multiscale MAP, or msMAP. Utilizing an overcomplete discrete wavelet transform, the new method divides each light curve into multiple channels, or bands. The light curves in each band are then corrected separately, thereby allowing for a better separation of characteristic signals and improved removal of the systematics.},

Unlike the split main sequences found in some globular clusters. which are caused by bimodal populations in age and/or chemical abundances, eMSTOs are believed to be owing to stellar rotation. We present a spectroscopic survey of MSTO stars in a nearby, intermediate-age (\textbackslash unit[0.9]\{Gyr\}), low mass (\$\textbackslash sim 1.7\textbackslash times10\^3 M\_\textbackslash odot\$) Galactic open cluster, NGC 5822. We derive a clean sample of member stars based on \textbackslash textit\{Gaia\} proper motions and parallaxes and confirm the existence of an eMSTO. Using medium-resolution (\$R\textbackslash sim 4000\$) Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) spectra, we derive the rotational velocities of 24 member stars (representing 20\textbackslash\% completeness around the eMSTO region) and find that the loci of the main sequence stars in the eMSTO region show a clear correlation with the projected rotational velocities in the sense that fast rotators are located on the red side of the eMSTO and slow rotators are found on the blue side. By comparison with a synthetic cluster model, we show that the stellar rotational velocities and the eMSTO of NGC 5822 can be well reproduced and we conclude that stellar rotation is the main cause of the eMSTO in NGC 5822.},

Using the phase lag method, we show that this star pulsates in the fundamental mode. New radial velocity data are consistent with previous measurements, suggesting that a long-period binary component is unlikely. No evidence is seen in the ultraprecise, nearly uninterrupted Kepler photometry for non-radial or stochastically excited modes at the micromagnitude level. The other candidates are not Cepheids, but an interesting mix of possible spotted stars, eclipsing systems and flare stars.},

Interestingly, all these pulsating stars show Blazhko modulation. The period doubling manifests itself as alternating maxima and minima of the pulsational cycles in the light curve, as well as through the appearance of half-integer frequencies located halfway between the main pulsation period and its harmonics in the frequency spectrum. The effect was found to be stronger during certain phases of the modulation cycle. We were able to reproduce the period-doubling bifurcation in our non-linear RR Lyrae models computed by the Florida\textendash Budapest hydrocode. This enabled us to trace the origin of this instability in RR Lyrae stars to a resonance, namely a 9:2 resonance between the fundamental mode and a high-order (ninth) radial overtone showing strange-mode characteristics. We discuss the connection of this new type of variation to the mysterious Blazhko effect and argue that it may give us fresh insights into solving this century-old enigma.},

We used high-resolution H-band spectra obtained by the SDSS-IV Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment. The advantage of using high-resolution spectra in the H band is that lines of CO are well represented and their line profiles are sensitive to the variation of 12C/13C. Values of the 12C/13C ratio were obtained from a spectrum synthesis analysis. The derived 12C/13C ratios varied between 6.3 and 10.6 in NGC 6791, in agreement with the final isotopic ratios from thermohaline-induced mixing models.

  abstract = {We analyse the results of a 5.5-yr photometric campaign that monitored  247 southern, semiregular variables with relatively precise Hipparcos parallaxes to demonstrate an unambiguous detection of red giant branch (RGB) pulsations in the solar neighbourhood. We show that Sequence A' contains a mixture of asymptotic giant branch and RGB stars, as indicated by a temperature-related shift at the tip of the red giant branch. Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Galactic sequences are compared in several ways to show that the period-luminosity sequence zero-points have a negligible metallicity dependence. We describe a new method to determine absolute magnitudes from pulsation periods and calibrate the LMC distance modulus using Hipparcos parallaxes to find {$\mu$}LMC = 18.54 +/- 0.03 mag. Several sources of systematic error are discussed to explain discrepancies between the Massive Compact Halo Object and Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment sequences in the LMC. We derive a relative distance modulus of the Small Magellanic Cloud relative to the LMC of {$\Delta\mu$} = 0.41 +/- 0.02 mag. A comparison of other pulsation properties, including period-amplitude and luminosity-amplitude relations, confirms that RGB pulsation properties are consistent and universal, indicating that the RGB sequences are suitable as high-precision distance indicators. The M giants with the shortest periods bridge the gap between G and K giant solar-like oscillations and M-giant pulsation, revealing a smooth continuity as we ascend the giant branch.},

The atmospheric parameters (Teff = 7600 K, log g = 4.2, {$\xi$} = 3.1 km s-1 and [Fe/H] = -0.71 dex), the radial and rotation velocities, and elemental abundances were obtained by analysing line strengths and fitting line profiles, which were calculated with a 1D LTE model atmosphere. The main properties of KIC 11145123 are: (1) a low [Fe/H] = -0.71 {$\pm$} 0.11 dex and a high radial velocity of -135.4 {$\pm$} 0.2 km s-1. These are remarkable among late-A stars. Our best asteroseismic models with this low [Fe/H] have slightly high helium abundance and low masses of 1.4 M . All of these results strongly suggest that KIC 11145123 is a Population II blue straggler; (2) the projected rotation velocity confirms the asteroseismically predicted slow rotation of the star; (3) comparisons of abundance patterns between KIC 11145123 and Am, Ap, and blue stragglers show that KIC 11145123 is neither an Am star nor an Ap star, but has abundances consistent with a blue straggler. We conclude that the remarkably long 100-d rotation period of this star is a consequence of it being a blue straggler, but both pathways for the formation of blue stragglers \textendash{} merger and mass loss in a binary system \textendash{} pose difficulties for our understanding of the exceedingly slow rotation. In particular, we show that there is no evidence of any secondary companion star, and we put stringent limits on the possible mass of any such purported companion through the phase modulation technique.},

These two kinds of spectroscopic and seismic information suffice to define the position on the `luminosity versus effective temperature' diagram and to assign an appropriate theoretical evolutionary track to each star. Making use of this advantage, we examined whether the stellar location on this diagram really matches the assigned track, which would make an interesting consistency check between theory and observation. It turned out that satisfactory agreement was confirmed in most cases ({$\sim$}90 per cent, though appreciable discrepancies were seen for some stars such as higher mass red-clump giants), suggesting that recent stellar evolution calculations are practically reliable. Since the relevant stellar age could also be obtained by this comparison, we derived the age\textendash metallicity relation for these Kepler giants and found the following characteristics: (1) the resulting distribution is quite similar to what was previously concluded for F-, G-, and K-type stars dwarfs; (2) the dispersion of metallicity progressively increases as the age becomes older; (3) nevertheless, the maximum metallicity at any stellar age remains almost flat, which means the existence of super/near-solar metallicity stars in a considerably wide age range from {$\sim$}(2\textendash 3) \texttimes{} 108 to {$\sim$}1010 yr.},

Based on the high-dispersion spectra of selected such 55 red giants in the Kepler field with precisely known seismic parameters (among which parallaxes are available for nine stars), we checked the accuracy of the determination method of stellar parameters previously applied to many red giants by Takeda et al. (PASJ, 60, 781), since it may be possible to discriminate their complex evolutionary status by using the surface gravity versus mass diagram. We confirmed that our spectroscopic gravity and the seismic gravity satisfactorily agree with each other (to within 0.1 dex) without any systematic difference. However, the mass values of Heburning red clump giants derived from stellar evolutionary tracks ({$\sim$}2\textendash 3 M ) were found to be markedly larger by {$\sim$}50 per cent compared to the seismic values ({$\sim$}1\textendash 2 M ) though such discrepancy is not seen for normal giants in the H-burning phase, which reflects the difficulty of mass determination from intricately overlapping tracks on the luminosity versus effective temperature diagram. This consequence implies that the mass results of many red giants in the clump region determined by Takeda et al. are likely to be significantly overestimated. We also compare our spectroscopically established parameters with recent literature values, and further discuss the prospect of distinguishing the evolutionary status of red giants based on the conventional (i.e. non-seismic) approach.},

We have also newly detected one possible detached binary member about 3.5 mag below the turnoff. One EW-type binary (probably not a cluster member) shows unusually strong night-to-night light curve variations in sets of observations separated by eight years. According to the best current information, the three brightest variables we detected (two of them new) are cluster members, making them blue stragglers. The first one is a {$\delta$} Scu pulsating variable, the second one is a close but detached binary, and the third one contains a detached short-period binary that shows total eclipses. In each case, however, there is evidence hinting that the system may have been produced through the interaction of more than two stars.},

We extracted the frequencies of the radial and quadrupole modes from its frequency power spectrum and determined its properties using a grid of evolutionary models constructed with MESA. The oscillation frequencies were calculated using the GYRE code and the surface term was corrected using the Ball \& Gizon(2014) prescription. We find that the star has a mass of \$M/M\_\{\textbackslash odot\} = 1.793\textbackslash pm 0.072\$, age \$t=1.48\textbackslash pm 0.21\$ Gyr and radius \$R/R\_\{\textbackslash odot\} = 10.53\textbackslash pm 0.28\$. By analyzing the internal structure of the best-fitting model, we infer the evolutionary status of the star KIC 8263801 as being on the ascending part of the red giant branch, and not on the red clump. This result is verified using a purely asteroseismic diagnostic, the \$\textbackslash epsilon\_\{c\}-\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash nu\_\{c\}\$ diagram which can distinguish red giant branch stars from red clump stars. Finally, by comparing its age with NGC 6866 (\$t=0.65 \textbackslash pm 0.1\$ Gyr) we conclude that KIC 8263801 is not a member of this open cluster.},

When we compare these data to theoretical predictions, we find a metallicity dependent temperature offset with a slope of around 100 K per dex in metallicity. We find that this effect is present in all model grids tested, and that theoretical uncertainties in the models, correlated spectroscopic errors, and shifts in the asteroseismic mass scale are insufficient to explain this effect. Stellar models can be brought into agreement with the data if a metallicity-dependent convective mixing length is used, with {$\Delta$} {$\alpha$} ML,YREC {$\sim$} 0.2 per dex in metallicity, a trend inconsistent with the predictions of three-dimensional stellar convection simulations.

Based on 1460 d of Kepler observations we perform a thorough asteroseismic study to probe the stellar parameters and evolutionary stages of three red giants in eclipsing binary systems. We present the first detailed analysis of individual oscillation modes of the red-giant components of KIC 8410637, KIC 5640750, and KIC 9540226. We obtain estimates of their asteroseismic masses, radii, mean densities, and logarithmic surface gravities by using the asteroseismic scaling relations as well as grid-based modelling. As these red giants are in double-lined eclipsing binaries, it is possible to derive their independent dynamical masses and radii from the orbital solution and compare it with the seismically inferred values. For KIC 5640750 we compute the first spectroscopic orbit based on both components of this system. We use high-resolution spectroscopic data and light curves of the three systems to determine up-to-date values of the dynamical stellar parameters. With our comprehensive set of stellar parameters we explore consistencies between binary analysis and asteroseismic methods, and test the reliability of the well-known scaling relations. For the three red giants under study, we find agreement between dynamical and asteroseismic stellar parameters in cases where the asteroseismic methods account for metallicity, temperature, and mass dependence as well as surface effects. We are able to attain agreement from the scaling laws in all three systems if we use {$\nu$}ref,emp = 130.8 {$\pm$} 0.9 {$\mu$}Hz instead of the usual solar reference value.},

We can explain the dominant features of the entire class with orbitally varying tidal forces that occur in close, eccentric binary systems. The large variety of light curve shapes arises from viewing systems at different angles. This hypothesis is supported by spectroscopic radial velocity measurements for five systems, each showing evidence of being in an eccentric binary system. Prior to the discovery of these 17 new systems, only four stars, where KOI-54 is the best example, were known to have evidence of these dynamic tides and tidally induced oscillations.

  abstract = {Context. Asteroseismology is a powerful tool for investigating physical processes in stars. Solar-like oscillations of main-sequence stars and red giant stars have been observed through ground-based observations and space missions. Aims. We analyzed seven seasons of short-cadence data, which was obtained with the Kepler Mission and corrected by WG\#1, of a solar-type star of spectral type F: KIC 6225718 and obtained more information concerning solar-like stars. Methods. We extracted oscillation modes from the power spectrum of KIC 6225718 and compared the theoretical acoustic spectrum with the extracted modes in order to determine the parameters of the star accurately. Results. We identified 33 p-modes with angular degree l=0-2 in the frequency range of 1600 - 2800 \textmu Hz, and obtained the large frequency separation {$\increment\nu$} = 105.78 {$\pm$} 0.65 \textmu Hz and the frequency of maximum power spectrum {$\nu$}max = 2301 {$\pm$} 21 \textmu Hz. We got values for the star's physical parameters: the range of mass M = 1.13{$\pm$}0.03M{$\odot$}, the radius R = 1.23{$\pm$}0.01R{$\odot$}, and the age t = 3.03{$\pm$}0.42 Gyr, which is at the phase of main sequence. We analyzed the effects of overshooting, and determined that the models with overshooting {$\alpha$}ov = 0.2 are in better agreement with observations. The ratio of small to large separations r01 which is related to the internal structure of the star could be used to test physical processes in stellar interiors free from the near-surface effects.},

These stars may have more precise distance estimates from spectrophotometry than from Gaia parallaxes beyond 3 kpc. However, RC stars have values of T eff and \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/858/1/L7/apjlaabf8eieqn1.gif] \$\textbackslash mathrmlogg\$ that are very similar to some red giant branch (RGB) stars. Especially for low-resolution spectroscopic studies where T eff , \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/858/1/L7/apjlaabf8eieqn2.gif] \$\textbackslash mathrmlogg\$ , and [Fe/H] can only be estimated with limited precision, separating RC stars from RGB through established methods can incur {$\sim$}20\% contamination. Recently, Hawkins et al. demonstrated that the additional information in single-epoch spectra, such as the C/N ratio, can be exploited to cleanly differentiate RC and RGB stars. In this second paper of the series, we establish a data-driven mapping from spectral flux space to independently determined asteroseismic parameters, the frequency and the period spacing. From this, we identify 210,371 RC stars from the publicly available LAMOST DR3 and APOGEE DR14 data, with {$\sim$}9\% of contamination. We provide an RC sample of 92249 stars with a contamination of only {$\sim$}3\%, by restricting the combined analysis to LAMOST stars with S/N pix {$\geq$} 75. This demonstrates that high-signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), low-resolution spectra covering a broad wavelength range can identify RC samples at least as pristine as their high-resolution counterparts. As coming and ongoing surveys such as TESS, DESI, and LAMOST will continue to improve the overlapping training spectroscopic-asteroseismic sample, the method presented in this study provides an efficient and straightforward way to derive a vast yet pristine sample of RC stars to reveal the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {Methods. We applied an automated supervised photometric classification method to select a sample of 69 Gamma Doradus ({$\gamma$} Dor) candidate stars. We used an advanced method to extract the Kepler light curves from the pixel data information using custom masks. For 36 of the stars, we obtained high-resolution spectroscopy with the HERMES spectrograph installed at the Mercator telescope. The spectroscopic data are analysed to determine the fundamental parameters like Teff, log g, v sin i, and [M/H]. Results. We find that all stars for which spectroscopic estimates of Teff and log g are available fall into the region of the HR diagram, where the {$\gamma$} Dor and {$\delta$} Sct instability strips overlap. The stars cluster in a 700 K window in effective temperature; log g measurements suggest luminosity class IV-V, i.e. sub-giant or main-sequence stars. From the Kepler photometry, we identify 45 {$\gamma$} Dor-type pulsators, 14 {$\gamma$} Dor/{$\delta$} Sct hybrids, and 10 stars, which are classified as ``possibly {$\gamma$} Dor/{$\delta$} Sct hybrid pulsators''. We find a clear correlation between the spectroscopically derived v sin i and the frequencies of independent pulsation modes. Conclusions. We have shown that our photometric classification based on the light curve morphology and colour information is very robust. The results of spectroscopic classification perfectly agree with the photometric classification. We show that the detected correlation between v sin i and frequencies has nothing to do with rotational modulation of the stars but is related to their stellar pulsations. Our sample and frequency determinations offer a good starting point for seismic modelling of slow to moderately rotating {$\gamma$} Dor stars.},

As part of the WIYN Open Cluster Study, we present precise ({$\sigma$} = 0.38 km s \textendash 1 ) radial velocities for proper motion candidate members of NGC 6791 from Platais et al. Our survey, extending down to g ' 16.8, is comprised of the evolved cluster population, including blue stragglers, giants, and horizontal branch stars. Of the 280 proper-motion-selected stars above our magnitude limit, 93\% have at least one radial velocity measurement and 79\% have three measurements over the course of at least 200 days, sufficient for secure radial-velocity-determined membership of non-velocity-variable stars. The Platais et al. proper motion catalog includes 12 anomalous horizontal branch candidates blueward of the red clump, of which we find only 4 to be cluster members. Three fall slightly blueward of the red clump and the fourth is consistent with being a blue straggler. The cleaned color-magnitude diagram shows a richly populated red giant branch and a blue straggler population. Half of the blue stragglers are in binaries. From our radial velocity measurement distribution, we find the cluster's radial velocity dispersion to be {$\sigma$} c = 0.62 {$\pm$} 0.10 km s \textendash 1 .

  abstract = {This article presents and discusses a critical compilation of accurate, fundamental determinations of stellar masses and radii. We have identified 95 detached binary systems containing 190 stars (94 eclipsing systems, and {$\alpha$} Centauri) that satisfy our criterion that the mass and radius of both stars be known within errors of {$\pm$}3\% accuracy or better. All of them are non-interacting systems, and so the stars should have evolved as if they were single. This sample more than doubles that of the earlier similar review by Andersen (Astron Astrophys Rev 3:91-126, 1991), extends the mass range at both ends and, for the first time, includes an extragalactic binary. In every case, we have examined the original data and recomputed the stellar parameters with a consistent set of assumptions and physical constants. To these we add interstellar reddening, effective temperature, metal abundance, rotational velocity and apsidal motion determinations when available, and we compute a number of other physical parameters, notably luminosity and distance. These accurate physical parameters reveal the effects of stellar evolution with unprecedented clarity, and we discuss the use of the data in observational tests of stellar evolution models in some detail. Earlier findings of significant structural differences between moderately fast-rotating, mildly active stars and single stars, ascribed to the presence of strong magnetic and spot activity, are confirmed beyond doubt. We also show how the best data can be used to test prescriptions for the subtle interplay between convection, diffusion, and other non-classical effects in stellar models. The amount and quality of the data also allow us to analyse the tidal evolution of the systems in considerable depth, testing prescriptions of rotational synchronisation and orbital circularisation in greater detail than possible before. We show that the formulae for pseudo-synchronisation of stars in eccentric orbits predict the observed rotations quite well, except for very young and/or widely separated stars. Deviations do occur, however, especially for stars with convective envelopes. The superior data set finally demonstrates that apsidal motion rates as predicted from General Relativity plus tidal theory are in good agreement with the best observational data. No reliable binary data exist, which challenge General Relativity to any significant extent. The new data also enable us to derive empirical calibrations of M and R for single (post-) main-sequence stars above \{0.6 M\_\{odot\}\}. Simple, polynomial functions of T \textsubscript{eff}, log g and [Fe/H] yield M and R within errors of 6 and 3\%, respectively. Excellent agreement is found with independent determinations for host stars of transiting extrasolar planets, and good agreement with determinations of M and R from stellar models as constrained by trigonometric parallaxes and spectroscopic values of T \textsubscript{eff} and [Fe/H]. Finally, we list a set of 23 interferometric binaries with masses known to be better than 3\%, but without fundamental radius determinations (except {$\alpha$} Aur). We discuss the prospects for improving these and other stellar parameters in the near future.},

The results so far show that the current models are unable to reproduce the rotation ratios, predicting higher values than what is observed and thus indicating that an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism should be at work. Here we provide an asteroseismic analysis of a sample of 13 low-luminosity low-mass red giant stars observed by Kepler during its first nominal mission. These targets form a subsample of the 19 red giants studied previously, which not only have a large number of extracted oscillation frequencies, but also unambiguous mode identifications.},

Analysis of the color-magnitude diagram reveals a color gradient between the core of the cluster and its periphery; we evaluate the potential explanations for this trend. While binarity and photometric errors appear unlikely, reddening variations across the face of the cluster cannot be excluded.

  abstract = {Methods. We compile a database of physical parameters for the sample stars from the literature and new ground-based observations. We analyse the Kepler light curve of each star and extract the pulsational frequencies using different frequency analysis methods. We construct two new observables, ``energy'' and ``efficiency'', related to the driving energy of the pulsation mode and the convective efficiency of the outer convective zone, respectively. Results. We propose three main groups to describe the observed variety in pulsating A-F type stars: {$\gamma$} Dor, {$\delta$} Sct, and hybrid stars. We assign 63\% of our sample to one of the three groups, and identify the remaining part as rotationally modulated/active stars, binaries, stars of different spectral type, or stars that show no clear periodic variability. 23\% of the stars (171 stars) are hybrid stars, which is a much higher fraction than what has been observed before. We characterize for the first time a large number of A-F type stars (475 stars) in terms of number of detected frequencies, frequency range, and typical pulsation amplitudes. The majority of hybrid stars show frequencies with all kinds of periodicities within the {$\gamma$} Dor and {$\delta$} Sct range, also between 5 and 10 d-1, which is a challenge for the current models. We find indications for the existence of {$\delta$} Sct and {$\gamma$} Dor stars beyond the edges of the current observational instability strips. The hybrid stars occupy the entire region within the {$\delta$} Sct and {$\gamma$} Dor instability strips and beyond. Non-variable stars seem to exist within the instability strips. The location of {$\gamma$} Dor and {$\delta$} Sct classes in the (Teff, log g)-diagram has been extended. We investigate two newly constructed variables, ``efficiency'' and ``energy'', as a means to explore the relation between {$\gamma$} Dor and {$\delta$} Sct stars. Conclusions. Our results suggest a revision of the current observational instability strips of {$\delta$} Sct and {$\gamma$} Dor stars and imply an investigation of pulsation mechanisms to supplement the {$\kappa$} mechanism and convective blocking effect to drive hybrid pulsations. Accurate physical parameters for all stars are needed to confirm these findings.},

  abstract = {Blue straggler stars (BSS) are well studied in globular clusters but their systematic study with secure membership determination is lacking in open clusters. We use Gaia DR2 data to determine accurate stellar membership for four intermediate-age open clusters, namely Melotte 66, NGC 2158, NGC 2506, and NGC 6819, and three old open clusters, namely, Berkeley 39, NGC 188, and NGC 6791, to subsequently study their BSS populations. The BSS radial distributions of five clusters, namely Melotte 66, NGC 188, NGC 2158, NGC 2506, and NGC 6791, show bimodal distributions, placing them with Family II globular clusters that are of intermediate dynamical ages. The location of minima, rmin, in the bimodal BSS radial distributions, varies from 1.5rc to 4.0rc, where rc is the core radius of the clusters. We find a positive correlation between rmin and Nrelax, the ratio of cluster age to the current central relaxation time of the cluster. We further report that this correlation is consistent in its slope, within the errors, with the slope of the globular cluster correlation between the same quantities, but with a slightly higher intercept. This is the first example in open clusters that shows BSS radial distributions as efficient probes of dynamical age. The BSS radial distributions of the remaining two clusters, Berkeley 39 and NGC 6819, are flat. The estimated Nrelax values of these two clusters, however, indicate that they are dynamically evolved. Berkeley 39 especially has its entire BSS population completely segregated to the inner regions of the cluster.},

  abstract = {We present a set of 87 RAVE stars with detected solar like oscillations, observed during Campaign 1 of the K2 mission (RAVE K2-C1 sample). This data set provides a useful benchmark for testing the gravities provided in RAVE data release 4 (DR4), and is key for the calibration of the RAVE data release 5 (DR5). The RAVE survey collected medium-resolution spectra (R = 7500) centred in the Ca II triplet (8600 \AA ) wavelength interval, which although being very useful for determining radial velocity and metallicity, even at low S/N, is known be affected by a log(g)-Teff degeneracy. This degeneracy is the cause of the large spread in the RAVE DR4 gravities for giants. The understanding of the trends and offsets that affects RAVE atmospheric parameters, and in particular log(g), is a crucial step in obtaining not only improved abundance measurements, but also improved distances and ages. In the present work, we use two different pipelines, GAUFRE and Sp\_Ace, to determine atmospheric parameters and abundances by fixing log(g) to the seismic one. Our strategy ensures highly consistent values among all stellar parameters, leading to more accurate chemical abundances. A comparison of the chemical abundances obtained here with and without the use of seismic log(g) information has shown that an underestimated (overestimated) gravity leads to an underestimated (overestimated) elemental abundance (e.g. [Mg/H] is underestimated by {$\sim$}0.25 dex when the gravity is underestimated by 0.5 dex). We then perform a comparison between the seismic gravities and the spectroscopic gravities presented in the RAVE DR4 catalogue, extracting a calibration for log(g) of RAVE giants in the colour interval 0.50 {$<$} (J - KS) {$<$} 0.85. Finally, we show a comparison of the distances, temperatures, extinctions (and ages) derived here for our RAVE K2-C1 sample with those derived in RAVE DR4 and DR5. DR5 performs better than DR4 thanks to the seismic calibration, although discrepancies can still be important for objects for which the difference between DR4/DR5 and seismic gravities differ by more than {$\sim$}0.5 dex. The method illustrated in this work will be used for analysing RAVE targets present in the other K2 campaigns, in the framework of Galactic Archaeology investigations.},

  abstract = {We performed a theoretical investigation focused on the age estimate of RGB stars in OCs based on mixed classical surface and asteroseismic parameters. We evaluated the performances of three widely adopted methods (pure geometrical fit, maximum likelihood approach, and a single stars fit) in recovering stellar parameters. Artificial OCs were generated by means of a Monte Carlo procedure for two different ages (7.5 and 9.0 Gyr) and two different choices of the number of stars in the RGB evolutionary phase (35 and 80). The geometrical approach overestimated the age by about 0.3 and 0.2 Gyr for true ages of 7.5 and 9.0 Gyr, respectively. The ML approach provided similar biases (0.1 and 0.2 Gyr) but with a variance reduced by a factor of between two and four with respect to geometrical fit. The independent fit of single stars showed a very large variance. The most important difference between geometrical and ML approaches was the robustness against observational errors. For the geometrical method, we found that estimations starting from the same sample but with different Gaussian perturbations on the observables had about 0.3 Gyr random variability from one Monte Carlo run to another (45\% of the intrinsic variability due to observational errors). On the other hand, for the ML method, this value was about 65\% and 90\% of the simulations failed to include the true parameter values in their estimated 1 sigma credible interval. Finally, we compared the performance of the three fitting methods for single RGB-star age estimation. The variability owing to the choice of the fitting method was minor, being about 15\% of the variability caused by observational uncertainties.},

  abstract = {Stellar evolution theory has been extraordinarily successful at explaining the different phases under which stars form, evolve and die. While the strongest constraints have traditionally come from binary stars, the advent of asteroseismology is bringing unique measures in well-characterised stars. For stellar populations in general, however, only photometric measures are usually available, and the comparison with the predictions of stellar evolution theory have mostly been qualitative. For instance, the geometrical shapes of isochrones have been used to infer ages of coeval populations, but without any proper statistical basis. In this chapter we provide a pedagogical review on a Bayesian formalism to make quantitative inferences on the properties of single, binary and small ensembles of stars, including unresolved populations. As an example, we show how stellar evolution theory can be used in a rigorous way as a prior information to measure the ages of stars between the ZAMS and the Helium flash, and their uncertainties, using photometric data only.},

This is the third brightest confirmed planet host star in the Kepler field and one of the brightest hosts of all currently known transiting exoplanets. Kepler-410 consists of a blend between the fast rotating planet host star (Kepler-410A) and a fainter star (Kepler-410B), which has complicated the confirmation of the planetary candidate. Employing asteroseismology, using constraints from the transit light curve, adaptive optics and speckle images, and Spitzer transit observations, we demonstrate that the candidate can only be an exoplanet orbiting Kepler-410A. We determine via asteroseismology the following stellar and planetary parameters with high precision; M = 1.214 {$\pm$} 0.033 M , R = 1.352 {$\pm$} 0.010 R , age = 2.76 {$\pm$} 0.54 Gyr, planetary radius (2.838 {$\pm$} 0.054 R{$\oplus$}), and orbital eccentricity (0.17+-00..0076). In addition, rotational splitting of the pulsation modes allows for a measurement of Kepler-410A's inclination and rotation rate. Our measurement of an inclination of 82.5+-72..55 [{$\smwhtcircle$}] indicates a low obliquity in this system. Transit timing variations indicate the presence of at least one additional (non-transiting) planet (Kepler-410A c) in the system.},

This also resulted directly in the identification of the modes that correspond to the detected pulsation frequencies, which for most stars were prograde dipole gravity and gravito-inertial modes. The majority of the observed retrograde modes were found to be Rossby modes. We also discuss the limitations of the method that are due to the neglect of the centrifugal force and the incomplete treatment of the Coriolis force. Conclusions.

  abstract = {Methods. We have derived a new asymptotic description which accounts for the impact of weak differential near-core rotation on gravity-mode period spacings. The theoretical predictions are illustrated from pulsation computations with the code GYRE and compared with observations of {$\gamma$} Dor stars. When possible, we also derived the surface rotation rates in these stars by detecting and analysing signatures of rotational modulation, and computed the core-to-surface rotation ratios. Results. Stellar rotation must be strongly differential before its effects on period spacing patterns can be detected, unless multiple period spacing patterns can be compared. Six stars in our sample exhibit a single unexplained period spacing pattern of retrograde modes. We hypothesise that these are Yanai modes. Finally, we find signatures of rotational spot modulation in the photometric data of eight targets. Conclusions. If only one period spacing pattern is detected and analysed for a star, it is difficult to detect differential rotation. A rigidly rotating model will often provide the best solution. Differential rotation can only be detected when multiple period spacing patterns have been found for a single star or its surface rotation rate is known as well. This is the case for eight of the stars in our sample, revealing surface-to-core rotation ratios between 0.95 and 1.05.},

Comparisons of isochrones with published color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for the open clusters M67 ([Fe/H] {$\approx$}0.0) and NGC 6791 ([Fe/H] {$\approx$}0.3) and for four of the metal-poor globular clusters (47 Tuc, M3, M5, and M92) indicate that the models for the observed metallicities do a reasonably good job of reproducing the locations and slopes of the cluster main sequences and giant branches. The same conclusion is reached from a consideration of plots of nearby subdwarfs that have accurate Hipparcos parallaxes and metallicities in the range -2.0 \&lt;\textasciitilde{} [Fe/H] \&lt;\textasciitilde{} -1.0 on various CMDs and on the (log T \textsubscript{eff}, M\textsubscript{V} ) diagram.

Such a valley has been observed recently, owing to an improvement in the precision of stellar and therefore planetary radii. Here, we investigate the presence, location, and shape of such a valley using a small sample with highly accurate stellar parameters determined from asteroseismology, which includes 117 planets with a median uncertainty on the radius of 3.3 per cent. We detect a clear bimodal distribution, with super-Earths ({$\approx$}1.5 R{$\oplus$}) and sub-Neptunes ({$\approx$}2.5 R{$\oplus$}) separated by a deficiency around 2 R{$\oplus$}. We furthermore characterize the slope of the valley as a power law R{$\propto$}P{$\gamma$} with {$\gamma$} = -0.09+-00..0024. A negative slope is consistent with models of photoevaporation, but not with the late formation of rocky planets in a gas-poor environment, which would lead to a slope of opposite sign. The exact location of the gap further points to planet cores consisting of a significant fraction of rocky material.},

In addition to statistical measurement errors, there are significant spatially correlated systematic errors, which cannot be ignored when studying the internal kinematics. We develop a mathematically consistent procedure for incorporating the spatial correlations in any model-fitting approach, and use it to determine rotation and velocity dispersion profiles of a few dozen clusters. We confirm detection of rotation in the sky plane for \textasciitilde 10 clusters reported in previous studies, and discover a few more clusters with rotation amplitudes exceeding \textasciitilde 0.05 mas/yr. However, in more than half of these cases the significance of this rotation signature is rather low when taking into account the systematic errors. We find that the PM dispersion is not sensitive to systematic errors in PM, however, it is quite sensitive to the selection criteria on the input sample, most importantly, in crowded central regions. When using the cleanest possible samples, PM dispersion can be reliably measured down to 0.1 mas/yr for \textasciitilde 60 clusters.},

  abstract = {The advent of space-based observatories such as Convection, Rotation and planetary Transits (CoRoT) and Kepler has enabled the testing of our understanding of stellar evolution on thousands of stars. Evolutionary models typically require five input parameters, the mass, initial helium abundance, initial metallicity, mixing length (assumed to be constant over time), and the age to which the star must be evolved. Some of these parameters are also very useful in characterizing the associated planets and in studying Galactic archaeology. How to obtain these parameters from observations rapidly and accurately, specifically in the context of surveys of thousands of stars, is an outstanding question, one that has eluded straightforward resolution. For a given star, we typically measure the effective temperature and surface metallicity spectroscopically and low-degree oscillation frequencies through space observatories. Here we demonstrate that statistical learning, using artificial neural networks, is successful in determining the evolutionary parameters based on spectroscopic and seismic measurements. Our trained networks show robustness over a broad range of parameter space, and critically, are entirely computationally inexpensive and fully automated. We analyse the observations of a few stars using this method and the results compare well to inferences obtained using other techniques. This method is both computationally cheap and inferentially accurate, paving the way for analysing the vast quantities of stellar observations from past, current, and future missions.},

  abstract = {The structural stratification of a star primarily depends on its mass and chemical composition. The surface heavy element abundances of the solar-type stars are reasonably well determined using conventional spectroscopy, however the second most abundant element helium is not. This is due to the fact that the envelope temperature of such stars is not high enough to excite helium. Since the helium abundance of a star affects its structure and subsequent evolution, the uncertainty in the helium abundance of a star makes estimates of its global properties (mass, radius, age etc.) uncertain as well. The detections of the signatures of the acoustic glitches from the precisely measured stellar oscillation frequencies provide an indirect way to estimate the envelope helium content. We use the glitch signature caused by the ionization of helium to determine the envelope helium abundance of 38 stars in the Kepler seismic LEGACY sample. Our results confirm that atomic diffusion does indeed take place in solar-type stars. We use the measured surface abundances in combination with the settling predicted by the stellar models to determine the initial abundances. The initial helium and metal mass fractions have subsequently been used to get the preliminary estimates of the primordial helium abundance, Yp = 0.244 {$\pm$} 0.019, and the galactic enrichment ratio, {$\increment$}Y /{$\increment$}Z = 1.226 {$\pm$} 0.849. Although the current estimates have large errorbars due to the limited sample size, this method holds great promises to determine these parameters precisely in the era of upcoming space missions.},

We perform glitch analysis for all the 66 stars in the Kepler seismic LEGACY sample to derive the locations of the base of the envelope convection zone (CZ) and the helium ionization zone. The signature from helium ionization zone is found to be robust for all stars in the sample, whereas the CZ signature is found to be weak and problematic, particularly for relatively massive stars with large errorbars on the oscillation frequencies.

  abstract = {NGC 6791 is a unique stellar cluster, key to our understanding of both the multiple stellar population phenomenon and the evolution and assembly of the Galaxy. However, despite many investigations, its nature is still very controversial. Geisler et al. found evidence suggesting that it was the first open cluster to possess multiple populations, but several subsequent studies did not corroborate this. It has also been considered a member of the thin or thick disk or even the bulge, and either as an open or globular cluster or even the remnant of a dwarf galaxy. Here we present and discuss detailed abundances derived from high-resolution spectra obtained with UVES at VLT and HIRES at Keck of 17 evolved stars of this cluster. We obtained a mean [Fe/H] = +0.313 {$\pm$} 0.005, in good agreement with recent estimates, and with no indication of star-to-star metallicity variation, as expected. We also did not find any variation in Na, in spite of having selected the very same stars as in Geisler et al., where an Na variation was claimed. This points to the presence of probable systematics in the lower-resolution spectra of this very high metallicity cluster analyzed in that work. In fact, we find no evidence for an intrinsic spread in any element, corroborating recent independent APOGEE data. The derived abundances indicate that NGC 6791 very likely formed in the Galactic bulge and that the proposed association with the thick disk is unlikely, despite its present Galactic location. We confirm the most recent hypothesis suggesting that the cluster could have formed in the bulge and radially migrated to its current location, which appears to be the best explanation for this intriguing object.

Among the stars observed, red giants show a rich oscillation pattern that allows their precise characterization.

A common pattern of oscillation frequency was observed in red giant stars, which corresponds to the second-order development of the asymptotic theory. This pattern, called the universal red giant oscillation pattern, describes the frequencies of stellar acoustic modes. We aim to investigate the deviations observed from this universal pattern, thereby characterizing them in terms of the location of the second ionization zone of helium.

This paper describes the experiment and how we met the challenge of ultraprecise photometry despite severe constraints on the mass, volume, and power available for the instrument.

Microlenses project Fabry images of the brighter (V{$<$}=10) target stars onto the science CCD. Fainter target stars will be focused directly elsewhere on the CCD. MOST was launched on 2003 June 30 into a low-Earth, Sun-synchronous, polar orbit allowing stars between -19\textdegree{} and +36\textdegree{} declination to be viewed continuously for up to 60 days. Attitude is controlled by reaction wheels and magnetotorquers. A solar safety shutter over the telescope diagonal is the only other moving part. Accumulated photometry will be used to calibrate response across the target field stop, and data will be compressed and downloaded to three dedicated ground stations.},

We find that M dwarfs tend to flare more frequently but for shorter durations than K dwarfs and that they emit more energy relative to their quiescent luminosity in a given flare than K dwarfs. Stars that are more photometrically variable in quiescence tend to emit relatively more energy during flares, but variability is only weakly correlated with flare frequency. We estimate distances for our sample of flare stars and find that the flaring fraction agrees well with other observations of flare statistics for stars within 300 pc above the Galactic plane. These observations provide a more rounded view of stellar flares by sampling stars that have not been pre-selected by their activity, and are informative for understanding the influence of these flares on planetary habitability.},

Spectroscopic observations revealed that this is a binary star with a highly eccentric orbit, e = 0.83. We are able to match the Kepler light curve and radial velocities with a nearly face-on (i = 5fdg5) binary star model in which the brightening events are caused by tidal distortion and irradiation of nearly identical A stars during their close periastron passage. The two dominant oscillations in the light curve, responsible for the beating pattern, have frequencies that are the 91st and 90th harmonic of the orbital frequency. The power spectrum of the light curve, after removing the binary star brightening component, reveals a large number of pulsations, 30 of which have a signal-to-noise ratio gsim7. Nearly all of these pulsations have frequencies that are either integer multiples of the orbital frequency or are tidally split multiples of the orbital frequency. This pattern of frequencies unambiguously establishes the pulsations as resonances between the dynamic tides at periastron and the free oscillation modes of one or both of the stars. KOI-54 is only the fourth star to show such a phenomenon and is by far the richest in terms of excited modes. {$<$}P /{$>$}Based in part on observations obtained at the W. M.

We present an ensemble asteroseismic analysis of 76 solar-type stars. Using frequencies determined from the Kepler time-series photometry, we have measured three asteroseismic parameters that characterize the oscillations: the large frequency separation ({$\Delta\nu$}), the small frequency separation between modes of l = 0 and l = 2 ({$\delta\nu$}02), and the dimensionless offset ( ). These measurements allow us to construct asteroseismic diagrams, namely the so-called Christensen\textendash Dalsgaard diagram of {$\delta\nu$}02 versus {$\Delta\nu$}, and the recently re-introduced diagram. We compare the Kepler results with previously observed solar-type stars and with theoretical models. The positions of stars in these diagrams places constraints on their masses and ages. Additionally, we confirm the observational relationship between and Teff that allows for the unambiguous determination of radial order and should help resolve the problem of mode identification in F stars.},

  abstract = {Asteroseismology is the study of oscillations in stars. Oscillation properties depend on the interior of the star and so probe the unseen depths. Asteroseismology therefore has an important role in understanding stellar physics. By determining oscillation frequencies, stellar properties such as mass, radius and age can be deduced, which are required for galactic population studies. A revolution in asteroseismology is taking place due to the Kepler Space Telescope. Kepler observations have increased the number of stars with detected solar-like oscillations by more than an order of magnitude, allowing for ensemble asteroseismology. Using a grid of stellar models we determined the values of several asteroseismic parameters. These parameters vary with stellar properties, thereby constraining stellar mass and age. We make comparisons between these models and the Kepler ensemble. Observations and models broadly agree, but interesting discrepancies highlight current deficiencies in stellar models. Additionally, the values of these parameters can aid in correctly identifying the angular degree of modes. The asteroseismic parameter {$\Delta\nu$} is expected to scale with the square-root of the mean stellar density. We investigate this scaling relation in models and observations. We find that a temperature-dependent departure exists, which has implications for masses and radii derived from this relation. As well as studying stars as an ensemble, interesting single stars provide insights. We investigate mode amplitude variability in the rapidly-oscillating Ap star HR 1217 using a time-frequency analysis, revealing unexpected behaviour. The science output of asteroseismology can be maximized with complementary measurements using other techniques. Using long-baseline optical interferometry we directly measured the radii of three of the brightest Kepler stars. These direct measurements, in conjunction with asteroseismic measurements, will provide strong constraints for modelling of these stars.},

In preparation for this golden age of asteroseismology we have computed expected values of various asteroseismic observables from models of varying mass and metallicity. The relationships between these asteroseismic observables, such as the separations between mode frequencies, are able to significantly constrain estimates of the ages and masses of these stars. We investigate the scaling relation between the large frequency separation, {$\Delta\nu$}, and mean stellar density. Furthermore we present model evolutionary tracks for several asteroseismic diagrams. We have extended the so-called C-D diagram beyond the main sequence to the subgiants and the red giant branch. We also consider another asteroseismic diagram, the {$\epsilon$} diagram, which is more sensitive to variations in stellar properties at the subgiant stages and can aid in determining the correct mode identification. The recent discovery of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants forms the basis for a third asteroseismic diagram. We compare the evolutionary model tracks in these asteroseismic diagrams with results from pre-Kepler studies of solar-like oscillations and early results from Kepler.},

However, only four systems are known in which solar-like oscillations are detected in both components. Here, we analyse the fifth such system, HD 176465, which was observed by Kepler. We carefully analysed the system's power spectrum to measure individual mode frequencies, adapting our methods where necessary to accommodate the fact that both stars oscillate in a similar frequency range. We also modelled the two stars independently by fitting stellar models to the frequencies and complementary parameters. We are able to cleanly separate the oscillation modes in both systems. The stellar models produce compatible ages and initial compositions for the stars, as is expected from their common and contemporaneous origin. Combining the individual ages, the system is about 3.0 {$\pm$} 0.5 Gyr old. The two components of HD 176465 are young physicallysimilar oscillating solar analogues, the first such system to be found, and provide important constraints for stellar evolution and asteroseismology.},

With the vast amount of data available from the CoRoT and Kepler missions, the convenience of the scaling relations has resulted in their wide-spread use. But how valid are the scaling relations when applied to red giants, which have a substantially different structure than the Sun? Verifying the scaling relations empirically requires independent measurements. We report on the current state and future prospects of interferometric tests of the scaling relations.},

  abstract = {The age distribution of galactic clusters is obtained from catalogues of well observed clusters compiled by Becker and Fenkart (1971) and Lindoff (1968). The observed age distribution of clusters within 1000 pc does not seem to be seriously affected by selection effects. Assuming a constant rate of formation of clusters, we deduce from the observed age distribution of clusters within 1000 pc statistical information about the total lifetimes of galactic clusters: 50\% of new clusters disintegrate within 2 10\^8 years, 10\% have a total lifetime longer than 5 10\^8 years, and only 2\% live longer than 10\^9 years. Hence, the typical lifetime is short, but there exists a wide spread in the individual lifetimes. The lifetimes obtained in this paper may serve as a powerful observational test of theories of the dynamical evolution of star clusters. We find that only a small fraction of field stars are former members of now dissolved galactic clusters. Moving groups should generally not be identified with disintegrated clusters. The relative dynamical age of a galactic cluster is rather weakly correlated with its absolute age. Therefore, and because of natural selection effects in the surviving old clusters, it is very unlikely that more direct observational information about the dynamical evolution of clusters can be obtained by studying objects of various ages.},

The first data release from Gaia (DR1) provides an extremely large and precise stellar catalogue, which when combined with the Tycho-2 catalogue gives the 2.5 million parallaxes and proper motions contained within the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS). Aims. We aim to identify new member candidates of the nearby Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus Complex within the TGAS catalogue. In doing so, we also aim to validate the use of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm on spatial and kinematic data as a robust member selection method. Methods. We constructed a method for member selection using a density-based clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) applied over proper motion and distance. We then applied this method to Upper Scorpius, and evaluated the results and performance of the method. Results. We identified 167 member candidates of Upper Scorpius, of which 78 are new, distributed within a 10\$\^\{\textbackslash circ\}\$ radius from its core. These member candidates have a mean distance of 145.6 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 7.5 pc, and a mean proper motion of (-11.4, -23.5) \$\textbackslash pm\$ (0.7, 0.4) mas/yr.

We are just learning to use this powerful tool, confronting theoretical models with observed frequencies and their time rate-of-change. With this tool, we calibrate white dwarf cosmochronology; we explore equations of state; we measure stellar masses, rotation rates, and nuclear reaction rates; we explore the physics of interior crystallization; we study the structure of the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, and we test models of dark matter.

Stars in a cluster are thought to be formed coevally from the same interstellar cloud of gas and dust; therefore, they are expected to have common properties. These common properties strengthen our ability to constrain theoretical models and/or to determine fundamental parameters, such as stellar mass, metal fraction, and distance, when tested against an ensemble of cluster stars. Here we derive a new relation based on solar-like oscillations, photometric observations, and the theory of stellar structure and evolution of red giant branch stars to determine cluster distance moduli through the global oscillation parameters {$\Delta\nu$} and {$\nu$}max and photometric data V. The values of {$\Delta\nu$} and {$\nu$}max are derived from Kepler observations. At the same time, it is used to interpret the trends between V and {$\Delta\nu$}. From the analyses of this newly derived relation and observational data of NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, we devise a method in which all stars in a cluster are regarded as one entity to determine the cluster distance modulus. This approach fully reflects the characteristic of member stars in a cluster as a natural sample. From this method we derive true distance moduli of 13.09 {$\pm$} 0.10 mag for NGC 6791 and 11.88 {$\pm$} 0.14 mag for NGC 6819. Additionally, we find that the distance modulus only slightly depends on the metallicity [Fe/H] in the new relation. A change of 0.1 dex in [Fe/H] will lead to a change of 0.06 mag in the distance modulus.},

We also take into account the influence of model precision. Finally, we find that the time resolution of stellar evolution cannot be ignored in high-precision asteroseismic analysis. Based on this, we find the acoustic radius t0 is the only global parameter that can be accurately measured by the cn2-matching method between observed frequencies and theoretical model calculations. We obtain t0 = 4601.5-+84..34 s. In addition, we analyze the distribution of cn2-minimization models (CMMs) and find that the distribution range of CMMs is slightly enlarged by some extreme cases, which possess both a larger mass and a higher (or lower) heavy element abundance, at the lower acoustic radius end.},

However, such age spreads do not exist in younger clusters (i.e., 40-300 Myr), which challenges this interpretation. The effects of rotation on the MSTOs of star clusters have been studied in previous works, but the results obtained are conflicting. Compared with previous works, we consider the effects of rotation on the main-sequence lifetime of stars. Our calculations show that rotating models have a fainter and redder MSTO with respect to non-rotating counterparts with ages between about 0.8 and 2.2 Gyr, but have a brighter and bluer MSTO when age is larger than 2.4 Gyr. The spread of the MSTO caused by a typical rotation rate is equivalent to the effect of an age spread of about 200 Myr. Rotation could lead to the double or extended MSTOs in the CMD of the star clusters with ages between about 0.8 and 2.2 Gyr. However, the extension is not significant, and it does not even exist in younger clusters. If the efficiency of the mixing were high enough, the effects of the mixing would counteract the effect of the centrifugal support in the late stage of evolution, and the rotationally induced extension would disappear in the old intermediate-age star clusters, but younger clusters would have an extended MSTO. Moreover, the effects of rotation might aid in understanding the formation of some ``multiple populations'' in globular clusters.},

  abstract = {The determination of the size of the convective core of main-sequence stars is usually dependent on the construction of models of stars. Here we introduce a method to estimate the radius of the convective core of mainsequence stars with masses between about 1.1 and 1.5 Me from observed frequencies of low-degree p-modes. A formula is proposed to achieve the estimation. The values of the radius of the convective core of four known stars are successfully estimated by the formula. The radius of the convective core of KIC 9812850 estimated by the formula is 0.140{$\pm$}0.028 Re. In order to confirm this prediction, a grid of evolutionary models was computed. The value of the convective-core radius of the best-fit model of KIC 9812850 is 0.149 Re, which is in good agreement with that estimated by the formula from observed frequencies. The formula aids in understanding the interior structure of stars directly from observed frequencies. The understanding is not dependent on the construction of models.},

The resultant color-magnitude diagram (CMD) shows a well-developed main sequence (MS) extending from V \textasciitilde{} 14.5 mag down to our photometric limit of V \textasciitilde{} 21 mag. Fitting theoretical isochrones with the adopted values of the reddening and metallicity (E(B - V) = 0.14, [Fe/H] = +0.09 dex) to the observed CMD yields a distance modulus of (m - M)0 = 11.93 {$\pm$} 0.10 and an age of \textasciitilde 2.6 Gyr for NGC 6819. Our wide-field imaging reveals that NGC 6819 is larger in areal extent (R = 13') than previously thought. The wide field also benefits our estimate of the degree of field star contamination, and ultimately yields improved measurements of the structural parameters (rc = 2.'80, rt = 38.'2, and rh = 7') and tidal mass of the cluster (M tid = 3542.4 M {$\odot$}). The flattened luminosity and mass functions indicate that NGC 6819 has experienced mass segregation as a result of its dynamical evolution.

We found prominent leading and trailing tails of stars along the cluster orbit, which demonstrates that Ruprecht\textasciitilde 147 is losing stars at fast pace. Star counts indicate the cluster has a core radius of 33.3 arcmin, and a tidal radius of 137.5 arcmin. The cluster also possesses an extended corona, which cannot be reproduced by a simple King model. We computed the present-day cluster mass using its luminosity and mass function, and derived an estimate of 234\$\textbackslash pm\$52 \$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. We also estimated the cluster original mass using available recipes extracted from N-body simulations obtaining a mass at birth of 50000\$\textbackslash pm\$6500 \$M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$. Therefore dynamical mass loss, mostly caused by tidal interaction with the Milky Way, reduced the cluster mass by about 99\textbackslash\%. We then conclude that Ruprecht\textasciitilde 147 is rapidly dissolving into the general Galactic disc.},

With the large amount of stellar data available for many clusters in the \emph{Gaia{$<$}i/{$>$} era, new techniques must be developed for analyzing open clusters, as visual inspection of cluster color-magnitude diagrams is no longer feasible.

If these hot stars are in their core helium-burning phase, they are significantly bluer (hotter) than predicted by canonical stellar evolution theory. No obvious explanation is available yet. We consider the effects of mass loss during the evolution of horizontal-branch (HB) stars as their possible origin. We find that the addition of mass loss causes HB stars to evolve to be hotter and fainter. Mass loss has a more pronounced effect for less massive stars and thus naturally widens the temperature (and color) distribution on the HB. If mass-loss rates are higher for more metal-rich stars, this phenomenon would be even more pronounced in the metal-rich populations, such as NGC 6791. We find that mass loss on the HB may be a viable method of forming subdwarf B (sdB) stars both in the field and in clusters, especially when the metallicity is high.},

Cluster member stars were separated from the field stars using the Galaxia model of Sharma et al. (2011) together with other techniques.

The resulting most likely parameters were further confirmed using independent methods, removing any possible degeneracies. The colour excess, distance modulus, metallicity and the age of the cluster are determined simultaneously as E(B-V)=0.05{$\pm$}0.01 mag, {$\mu$}=10.06{$\pm$}0.08 mag, [M/H]=-0.10{$\pm$}0.01 dex and t=1.00{$\pm$}0.05 Gyr, respectively.

In this work we systematically characterize solar-like oscillations and granulation for 16,094 oscillating red giants, using end-of-mission long-cadence data. We produced a homogeneous catalog of the frequency of maximum power (typical uncertainty ), the mean large frequency separation (), oscillation amplitude (), granulation power (), power excess width (), seismically derived stellar mass (), radius (), and thus surface gravity ( dex). Thanks to the large red giant sample, we confirm that red-giant-branch (RGB) and helium-core-burning (HeB) stars collectively differ in the distribution of oscillation amplitude, granulation power, and width of power excess, which is mainly due to the mass difference. The distribution of oscillation amplitudes shows an extremely sharp upper edge at fixed , which might hold clues for understanding the excitation and damping mechanisms of the oscillation modes. We find that both oscillation amplitude and granulation power depend on metallicity, causing a spread of 15\% in oscillation amplitudes and a spread of 25\% in granulation power from [Fe/H] = -0.7 to 0.5 dex. Our asteroseismic stellar properties can be used as reliable distance indicators and age proxies for mapping and dating galactic stellar populations observed by Kepler. They will also provide an excellent opportunity to test asteroseismology using Gaia parallaxes, and lift degeneracies in deriving atmospheric parameters in large spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE and LAMOST.},

In this letter we predicted for dwarfs and giants the jitter due to stellar oscillations, which in velocity have much larger amplitudes than noise introduced by granulation. We then fitted the jitter in terms of the following sets of stellar parameters: (1) Luminosity, mass, and effective temperature: the fit returns precisions (i.e. standard deviations of fractional residuals) of 17.9 and 27.1 per cent for dwarfs and giants, respectively. (2) Luminosity, effective temperature, and surface gravity: the precisions are the same as using the previous parameter set. (3) Surface gravity and effective temperature: we obtain a precision of 22.6 per cent for dwarfs and 27.1 per cent for giants. (4) Luminosity and effective temperature: the precision is 47.8 per cent for dwarfs and 27.5 per cent for giants. Our method will be valuable for anticipating the radial-velocity stellar noise level of exoplanet host stars to be found by the TESS and PLATO space missions, and thus can be useful for their follow-up spectroscopic observations. We provide publicly available code (https://github.com/Jieyu126/Jitter) to set a prior for the jitter term as a component when modelling the Keplerian orbits of the exoplanets.},

  abstract = {We have analyzed 18 quarters of long-cadence data of KIC 9145955 provided by Kepler, and extracted 61 oscillation frequencies from these high-precision photometric data. The oscillation frequencies include 7 l=0 modes, 44 l=1 modes, 7 l=2 modes, and 3 l=3 modes. We identify l=0 modes as p modes and l=2 modes as p-dominated modes. For l=1 modes, all of them are identified as mixed modes. These mixed modes can be used to determine the size of the helium core. We conduct a series of asteroseismic models and the size of the helium core is determined to be MHe=0.210 {$\pm$} 0.002 Me and RHe = 0.0307  0.0002 R. Furthermore, we find that only the acoustic radius {$\tau$}0 can be precisely determined with the asteroseismic method independently. The value of {$\tau$}0 is determined to be 0.494{$\pm$}0.001 days. By combining asteroseismic results and spectroscopic observations, we obtain the best-fitting model. The physical parameters of this model are M=1.24 Me, Z=0.009, {$\alpha$}=2.0, Teff=5069 K, log g=3.029, R=5.636 Re, and L=18.759 Le. In addition, we think that the observed frequency F39 (96.397 {$\mu$}Hz) is more appropriate to be identified as a mixed mode of the most p-dominated.},

  abstract = {We report the discovery of a new pulsating pre-He-WD in the EL CVn-type binary KIC 9164561. Light curve modeling and frequency analysis of the binary system were carried out based on short-cadence Kepler photometry. Combined with the radial-velocity solution, revised physical parameters of the binary system were determined. The component KIC 9164561B was confirmed to be a pre-He-WD star with M = 0.213  0.012M, R = 0.283  0.006R, and Teff = 10650  200 K. In addition to the light changes due to an eclipse, pulsational light variations of the pre-He-WD star were detected. The Fourier analysis reveals at least 52 frequencies, with the dominant one at 313.4 {$\mu$}Hz. A brief mode identification indicates that the pre-He-WD star pulsates in g-modes with an average period spacing of DPl=1 = 80.87 s. Moreover, a number of multiplets due to rotational splitting were identified from the frequency spectra. The rotational period of the pulsating pre-He-WD star was found to equal to the orbital period, indicating that KIC 9164561B is in synchronous rotation.},

We measure the rotation periods of 24 heartbeat systems, using the Kepler light curves to identify rotation peaks in the Fourier transform. Where possible, we compare the rotation period to the pseudosynchronization period derived by Hut. Few of our heartbeat stars are pseudosynchronized with the orbital period. For four systems, we were able to identify two sets of rotation peaks, which we interpret as the rotation from both stars in the binary. Most stars in our sample have rotation rates larger than the pseudosynchronization period while a single target rotates much faster than this rate. The majority of the systems have a rotation period that is approximately 3 times the pseudosynchronization period, suggesting that other physical mechanisms strongly influence the sta2r's evolution.},

  abstract = {We present an independent confirmation of the zero-point offset of Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) parallaxes using asteroseismic data of evolved stars in the Kepler field. Using well-characterized red giant branch (RGB) stars from the APOKASC-2 catalogue we identify a color- and magnitude-dependent zero-point offset of \$52.8 \textbackslash pm 2.4 (stat.) \textbackslash pm 1 (syst.) \textbackslash muas\$, in the sense that Gaia parallaxes are too small. The offset is present at nearly the same level in high and low extinction samples, and remains whether using Gaia DR2 or APOKASC-2 extinction estimates derived from SED fitting. The same exercise, performed with core He-burning red clump stars, yields an offset in the same sense of \$50.2 \textbackslash pm 2.5 (stat.) \textbackslash pm 1 (syst.) \textbackslash muas\$. We argue that the difference between these two measures likely reflects known systematic differences in the APOKASC-2 radius scale of RC and RGB stars at the \$1\textbackslash\%\$ level. We recommend adopting the RGB scale because the APOKASC-2 sample was calibrated on RGB stars. Because of possible spatially-correlated parallax errors, as discussed by the Gaia team, our zero-point solution is specific to the Kepler field, but broadly compatible with the global zero-point uncertainty inferred by the Gaia team and independent results using Cepheids. Additionally, there is evidence for a larger absolute offset error for smaller parallaxes, which we will explore in future work.},

Its second data release (GALAH DR2) provides values of stellar parameters and abundances of 23 elements for 342 682 stars (Buder et al.). Here we add a description of the public release of radial velocities with a typical accuracy of 0.1 km s-1 for 336 215 of these stars, achievable due to the large wavelength coverage, high resolving power, and good signal-to-noise ratio of the observed spectra, but also because convective motions in stellar atmosphere and gravitational redshift from the star to the observer are taken into account. In the process we derive medians of observed spectra that are nearly noiseless, as they are obtained from between 100 and 1116 observed spectra belonging to the same bin with a width of 50 K in temperature, 0.2 dex in gravity, and 0.1 dex in metallicity. Publicly released 1181 median spectra have a resolving power of 28 000 and trace the well-populated stellar types with metallicities between -0.6 and +0.3. Note that radial velocities from GALAH are an excellent match to the accuracy of velocity components along the sky plane derived by Gaia for the same stars. The level of accuracy achieved here is adequate for studies of dynamics within stellar clusters, associations, and streams in the Galaxy. So it may be relevant for studies of the distribution of dark matter.},
