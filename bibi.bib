  abstract = {We present an analysis of a slightly eccentric (e=0.05), partially eclipsing, long-period (P=69.73 days) mainsequence binary system (WOCS 12009, Sanders 1247) in the benchmark old open cluster M67. Using Kepler K2 and ground-based photometry, along with a large set of new and reanalyzed spectra, we derived highly precise masses (1.111{$\pm$}0.015 and 0.748{$\pm$}0.005 Me) and radii (1.071{$\pm$}0.008{$\pm$}0.003 and 0.713{$\pm$}0.019{$\pm$}0.026 Re, with statistical and systematic error estimates) for the stars. The radius of the secondary star is in agreement with theory. The primary, however, is approximately 15\% smaller than reasonable isochrones for the cluster predict. Our best explanation is that the primary star was produced from the merger of two stars, as this can also account for the nondetection of photospheric lithium and its higher temperature relative to other cluster main-sequence stars at the same V magnitude. To understand the dynamical characteristics (low measured rotational line broadening of the primary star and low eccentricity of the current binary orbit), we believe that the most probable (but not the only) explanation is the tidal evolution of a close binary within a primordial triple system (possibly after a period of Kozai\textendash{}Lidov oscillations), leading to merger approximately 1 Gyr ago. This star appears to be a future blue straggler that is being revealed as the cluster ages and the most massive main-sequence stars die out.},

  volume = {22},
  abstract = {NGC\textasciitilde{}6791 is a rich open cluster that attracted a lot of attention in the last decade. Recent estimates indicate that the mass is even larger, around 5000\textbackslash,\$\textbackslash{}mathrm\{M\}\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\$. This is quite remarkable: the cluster is in fact 8\textbackslash,Gyr old, while the typical dissolution time for Galactic open clusters is a few Myr only. This might imply that the cluster managed to survive so long either because its original mass was much larger, or because it moved along a preferential orbit. In any case, such combination of old age and large mass is unique among Galactic open clusters, especially for clusters located in the inner regions of the Galactic disk. This is not the only special property of NGC 6791. Its abundance in iron is [Fe/H] \$\textbackslash{}sim\$ +0.40. again unique among Galactic star clusters of the same age range. Significant dispersions in various elements have been detected, that are not routinely found in Galactic open clusters. The combined UV flux of the few hot HB stars makes the cluster the closest proxy of an elliptical galaxy. This surprising result might indeed indicate that NGC 6791 was massive enough at origin to experience a strong burst of star formation and a fast enrichment.This pletora of unique properties renders NGC 6791 an extremely important object to study and understand.How and where could such a stellar system have formed? Is NGC 6791 just an open cluster? Did it form close to the bulge? How could have survived in the adverse, high-density, environment of the inner Galactic disk?These are difficult questions to answer to, of course. One of the still missing key observational evidence is whether the cluster suffered from tidal interaction, that could have significantly decreased its mass. We find such evidences, and use them as an argument to support a scenario in which the cluster formed as a massive object. We also estimate, using approximate analytic description based on available \$N\$-body models, how much mass NGC\textasciitilde{}6791 lost, and which was its probable mass at formation.},

  abstract = {NGC 6791 is one of the most studied open clusters, it is massive ({$\sim$}5000 M ), located at the solar circle, old ({$\sim$}8 Gyr) and yet the most metal-rich cluster ([Fe/H] 0.4) known in the Milky Way. By performing an orbital analysis within a Galactic model including spiral arms and a bar, we found that it is plausible that NGC 6791 formed in the inner thin disc or in the bulge, and later displaced by radial migration to its current orbit. We apply different tools to simulate NGC 6791, including direct N-body summation in time-varying potentials, to test its survivability when going through different Galactic environments. In order to survive the 8-Gyr journey moving on a migrating orbit, NGC 6791 must have been more massive, M0 {$\geq$} 5 \texttimes{} 104 M , when formed. We find independent confirmation of this initial mass in the stellar mass function, which is observed to be flat; this can only be explained if the average tidal field strength experienced by the cluster is stronger than what it is at its current orbit. Therefore, the birth place and journeys of NGC 6791 are imprinted in its chemical composition, in its mass-loss and in its flat stellar mass function, supporting its origin in the inner thin disc or in the bulge.},

  abstract = {We propose to study the last HST-accessible white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence (CS) for a nearby globular cluster (GC), the chemically complex, extreme blue horizontal branch cluster NGC 6752. Over 97\% of stars end their lives as WDs, and the WD CS provides constraints not only on the age, but also potentially the star formation history of a GC. The CS of WDs also lies in the least-explored region of the color-magnitude diagram of old stellar populations. Recent deep imaging with HST has successfully reached the end of the WD CS in only three classical old GCs, M4, NGC 6397 and 47 Tuc, and reveals an unexpectedly complex, and double-peaked, WD CS in the metal rich old open cluster NGC 6791. One more investigation is in progress on the massive globular Omega Centauri, where over 14 sub-populations are known to exist.While almost every cluster is known to host multiple populations, every single cluster is unique. NGC 6752 is a bridge between the relatively simple globular clusters, and Omega Cen, the most complex globular cluster known. NGC 6752 has an extended blue horizontal branch, a collapsed core and 3 chemically distinct populations. It is our last chance to add diversity to our very limited sample of WD CS, so far containing only 3 globular clusters, one old open cluster, and the complex Omega Cen system. We need to undertake this investigation while HST is still operational, as there is no foreseeable opportunity in the post-HST era to have one extra WD CS in the homogeneus optical photometric system of HST.},

  abstract = {Methods. We adopted the Bayesian code Diamonds for the analysis of the background signal in the Fourier spectra of the stars. We performed a Bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison to test the different model hypotheses proposed in this work and in the literature.
Results. Metallicity causes a statistically significant change in the amplitude of the granulation activity, with a dependency stronger than that induced by both stellar mass and surface gravity. We also find that the metallicity has a significant impact on the corresponding time scales of the phenomenon. The effect of metallicity on the time scale is stronger than that of mass.
Conclusions. A higher metallicity increases the amplitude of granulation and meso-granulation signals and slows down their characteristic time scales toward longer periods. The trend in amplitude is in qualitative agreement with predictions from existing 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar atmospheres from main sequence to red giant stars. We confirm that the granulation activity is not sensitive to changes in the stellar core and that it only depends on the atmospheric parameters of stars.},

While there has been speculation on what mechanisms may create these unusual stars, no well-developed theory exists to explain their origins. Here we discuss three hypotheses of SSG formation: (1) mass transfer in a binary system, (2) stripping of a subgiant's envelope, perhaps during a dynamical encounter, and (3) reduced luminosity due to magnetic fields that lower convective efficiency and produce large starspots. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we develop evolutionary tracks for each of these hypotheses, and compare the expected stellar and orbital properties of these models with six known SSGs in the two open clusters M67 and NGC 6791. All three of these mechanisms can create stars or binary systems in the SSG CMD domain. We also calculate the frequency with which each of these mechanisms may create SSG systems, and find that the magnetic field hypothesis is expected to create SSGs with the highest frequency in open clusters. Mass transfer and envelope stripping have lower expected formation frequencies, but may nevertheless create occasional SSGs in open clusters. They may also be important mechanisms to create SSGs in higher mass globular clusters.},

We examine this issue for giant stars by comparing classical measurements of detached eclipsing binary systems (dEBs) with asteroseismic measurements from the Kepler mission. For star clusters, we extrapolate measurements of dEBs in the turn-off region to the red giant branch and the red clump where we investigate the giants as an ensemble. For the field stars, we measure dEBs with an oscillating giant component. These measurements allow a comparison of masses and radii calculated from a classical eclipsing binary analysis to those calculated from asteroseismic scaling relations and/or other asteroseismic methods. Our first results indicate small but significant systematic differences between the classical and asteroseismic measurements. In this contribution we show our latest results and summarize the current status and future plans. We also stress the importance of realizing that for giant stars mass cannot always be translated to age, since an unknown fraction of these evolved through a blue straggler phase with mass transfer in a binary system.

  abstract = {There is a large population of stars not described by single-star stellar evolution narratives. These non-standard stars are broadly known as blue stragglers (BS), yellow giants, and subsubgiants (SSG). In this thesis I present my work on the non-standard stellar populations in open clusters focussing on the role of binaries and the information learned from surface abundance measurements, particularly for BS formation.
Formation theories for BSs include mergers in hierarchical triple systems, collisions during dynamical encounters, and mass transfer from an evolved companion. Such mass transfer events can pollute the surface abundance of the BS with the nucleosynthesis products from the evolved donor. Specifically, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) mass transfer should enhance the surface abundances of s-process elements, like barium, created during the thermally-pulsing phase of AGB evolution. The products of mergers and collisions would have no such enhancements. This makes barium an excellent marker for a mass-transfer formation history with an AGB-donor.
In this thesis I start with the radial velocity (RV) surveys of the open clusters NGC 6819 and NGC 7789. I then introduce my discovery of five barium enriched BSs in NGC 6819, four of which have no RV evidence of a companion. Next, I triple the number of confirmed open cluster SSGs through my discovery of four such systems in NGC 6791 and present robust orbital solutions for three of them. And finally I discuss the implications of my work in context with the extensively studied open clusters M67 and NGC 188.},

  abstract = {We discuss the possibility of finding the birthplaces of open clusters (OC) with ages of several billion years. The proposed method is based on the comparison of the results of the chemical evolution modeling of the Galactic disk with the parameters of the cluster. Five OCs older than 7 Gyr are known: NGC 6791, BH 176, Collinder 261, Berkeley 17, and Berkeley 39. The oxygen and iron abundances in NGC 6791 and the oxygen abundance in BH 176 are twice the solar level, the heavy-element abundances in other clusters are close to the corresponding solar values. According to chemical evolution models, at the time of the formation of the objects considered the regions where the oxygen and iron abundances reached the corresponding levels extended out to 5 kpc from the Galactic center. At present time the OCs considered are located several kpc from the Galactic center. Some of these clusters are located extremely high , about 1 kpc above the disk midplane, i.e., they have been subject to some mechanism that has carried them into orbits uncharacteristic of this type of objects. It follows from a comparison with the results of chemical evolution that younger clusters with ages of 4\textendash{}5 Gyr, e.g., NGC 1193, M 67, and others, may have formed in a broad range of Galactocentric distances. Their large heights above the disk midplane is sufficient to suggest that these clusters have moved away from their likely birthplaces. Clusters are carried far away from the Galactic disk until the present time: about 40 clusters with ages from 0 to 2 Gyr are observed at heights ranging from 300 to 750 pc.},

  abstract = {In an optical color-magnitude diagram sub-subgiants (SSGs) lie red of the main-sequence and fainter than the red giant branch in a region not easily populated by standard stellar evolution theory. We present radial-velocity follow-up to five SSG candidates in the old open cluster NGC 6791 (8 Gyr, [Fe/H]= +0.3). Our observations began in 2014 July with the Hydra multi-object spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope. We find four SSGs to be three-dimensional kinematic members of NGC 6791, with three also being short-period binary systems. The existence of these newly discovered SSGs in NGC 6791 strengthens the case that SSGs are a new class of non-standard stellar products, and that a physical mechanism must be found that explains the unusual evolutionary path of these stars.

These measurements combined with analysis of the CH and CN band strengths of globular and open clusters of varying metallicity taken from the SEGUE database suggest a saturation of the CH band occurring at metallicities above [Fe/H] \textasciitilde{} -0.7 that is not predicted by the models. This saturation effect limits the usefulness of the CH and CN bands in determining the C and N abundances in open clusters. However, the models continue to accurately predict the CN band strengths at high metallicities and are used to statistically determine the likelihood of two populations existing in NGC 6791. The statistical analysis confirms NGC 6791 is most likely to have only one CN population.},

  abstract = {Stellar evolution and Galactic evolution have both been greatly advanced by the study of star clusters. In addition the elemental abundance results from clusters have revealed information about Galactic chemical evolution and nucleosynthesis. The cluster, NGC 6791, has a number of bizarre properties that make it especially interesting for comparative cluster studies. It is old (8.3 Gyr) yet metal-rich ([Fe/H] = +0.30). It has a heliocentric distance of 4 kpc and a galactic latitude of +11 degrees which makes it 1 kpc above the galactic plane. Its boxy orbit has a high eccentricity (\textasciitilde{}0.5) with a perigalactic distance of 3 kpc and an apogalactic distance of 10 kpc. The orbital period of \textasciitilde{}130 Myr indicates that it has crossed the Galactic plane several times yet has remained as an intact cluster. We have determined abundances from high-resolution (R = 46,000) Keck/HIRES spectra of turn-off stars in this open cluster NGC 6791. We have a solid determination of [Fe/H] = +0.30 +/-0.02 from measurements of some 40 unblended, unsaturated lines of both Fe I and Fe II in eight turn-off stars. Our O abundances come from the O I triplet near 7774 {\AA} and are corrected for small nLTE effects. We find consistent ratios of [O/Fe]n with a mean of -0.06 +/-0.02, indicating a single population of stars. Our results for the alpha elements [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] are near solar and compare well with those of old, metal-rich field stars. The Fe-peak elements, Cr and Ni, have values of [Cr/Fe] = +0.05 +/-0.02 and [Ni/Fe] = +0.04 +/-0.01. Determinations of upper limits were found for Li by spectrum synthesis; this is consistent with the upper limits in this temperature range for turn-off/subgiant stars in the relatively old, super-metal-rich cluster NGC 6253. We speculate that no stars in NGC 6791 have retained the Li with which they formed.},

A series of binary population synthesis (BPS) simulations have been carried out in order to see if binary interactions can produce a fuller HB population, especially EHB (extreme horizontal branch) stars, that canonical models fail to reproduce. In particular, the Han binary population synthesis code (Han 2000), together with results from BPS studies of the formation channels of sdB/EHb stars (Han et al. 2002, 2003) from common envelope (CE), stable Roche Lobe Overflow (RLOF), and WD merger events, are applied to NGC 6791.

  abstract = {Undoubtedly one the highlights of the Kepler asteroseismology programme has been the detection of solar-like oscillations in giants belonging to the open clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6819, and NGC 6811. The availability of such constraints has made it possible to infer precise stellar properties (e.g. radius, mass, evolutionary state, age) on a star-by-star basis.These constraints give us a ``new pair of eyes'' to look at clusters, and they open several exciting opportunities. Based on a detailed analysis of the complete set of 4-years-long Kepler data, we present clear evidence for stars that have undergone non-standard evolution (evolved blue stragglers, low-mass Li-rich stars). We then illustrate the potential of integrated-mass-loss and mass-loss-dispersion measurements in both NGC6791 and NGC6819, which suggest a small true mass scatter among the red-clump stars and thus a very small mass-loss dispersion.We will then show examples of how our analysis based on individual-mode frequencies, as opposed to average seismic parameters and scaling relations, allow us to determine with higher accuracy stellar properties, and to probe features in the deep stellar interior (i.e. acoustic glitches related to Helium ionisation, properties of near-core mixing in the He-core-burning phase).Finally, we will discuss the prospects for seismic analyses of other clusters, in particular the globular cluster M4 which could reveal new insights into mass-loss dispersion and its effect on the horizontal-branch morphology.},

We used deep and wide-field data obtained with the Canada\textendash{}France\textendash{}Hawaii Telescope covering a 2{$\smwhtcircle$} \texttimes{} 2{$\smwhtcircle$} area around the cluster. The 2D density map obtained with the optimal matched filter technique shows a clear elongation and an irregular distribution starting from {$\sim$}300 arcsec from the cluster centre. At larger distances, two tails extending in opposite directions beyond the tidal radius are also visible. These features are aligned to both the absolute proper motion and to the Galactic Centre directions. Moreover, other overdensities appear to be stretched in a direction perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Accordingly to the behaviour observed in the density map, we find that both the surface brightness and the star count density profiles reveal a departure from a King model starting from {$\sim$}600 arcsec from the centre. These observational evidence suggest that NGC 6791 is currently experiencing mass-loss likely due to gravitational shocking and interactions with the tidal field. We use this evidence to argue that NGC 6791 should have lost a significant fraction of its original mass. A larger initial mass would in fact explain why the cluster survived so long. Using available recipes based on analytic studies and N-body simulations, we derived the expected mass-loss due to stellar evolution and tidal interactions and estimated the initial cluster mass to be Mini = (1.5\textendash{}4) \texttimes{} 105 M .},

Our results for the alpha elements [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], and [Ti/Fe] are near solar and compare well with those of the old, metal-rich field stars. The two Fe-peak elements, Cr and Ni, are consistent with Fe. These turn-off-star abundances provide benchmark abundances to investigate whether there are any observable abundance differences with the giants that might arise from nuclear-burning and dredge-up processes. Determinations of upper limits were found for Li by spectrum synthesis and are consistent with the upper limits in similar stars in the relatively old, super-metal-rich cluster NGC 6253.

One major drawback of Kepler though was that it only read out a few pixels around pre-selected target stars and thus, no information was gathered for most of the stars in the Kepler field of view. Fortunately, for the open clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, Kepler also read out larger ``superstamps'' which contained complete images of the central region of each cluster. These cluster images can be used to study additional stars in the open clusters that were not originally on Kepler's target list. We adapted conventional crowded-field photometric routines to carry out photometry on these superstamps. We present select results from this study in order to show the power and usefulness of using the superstamps. The techniques created for this project will be even more useful in the new K2 mission which will include additional open clusters and, for the first time, globular clusters in its fields of view.},

  abstract = {We present a first determination of distances and extinctions for individual stars in the first release of the APOKASC catalogue, built from the joint efforts of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium (KASC). Our method takes into account the spectroscopic constraints derived from the APOGEE Stellar Parameters and Chemical Abundances Pipeline, together with the asteroseismic parameters from KASC. These parameters are then employed to estimate intrinsic stellar properties, including absolute magnitudes, using the Bayesian tool PARAM. We then find the distance and extinction that best fit the observed photometry in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), 2MASS, and WISE passbands. The first 1989 giants targetted by APOKASC are found at typical distances between 0.5 and 5 kpc, with individual uncertainties of just {$\sim$}1.8 per cent. Our extinction estimates are systematically smaller than provided in the Kepler Input Catalogue and by the Schlegel et al. maps. Distances to individual stars in the NGC 6791 and NGC 6819 star clusters agree to within their credible intervals. Comparison with the APOGEE red clump and SAGA catalogues provide another useful check, exhibiting agreement with our measurements to within a few per cent. Overall, present methods seem to provide excellent distance and extinction determinations for the bulk of the APOKASC sample. Approximately one third of the stars present broad or multiple-peaked probability density functions and hence increased uncertainties. Uncertainties are expected to be reduced in future releases of the catalogue, when a larger fraction of the stars will have seismically determined evolutionary status classifications.},

  abstract = {Galactic open and globular clusters (OCs, GCs) appear to inhabit separate regions of the age-mass plane. However, the transition between them is not easily defined because there is some overlap between high-mass, old OCs and low-mass, young GCs. We are exploring the possibility of a clear-cut separation between OCs and GCs using an abundance feature that has been found so far only in GCs: (anti)correlations between light elements. Among the coupled abundance trends, the Na-O anticorrelation is the most widely studied. These anticorrelations are the signature of self-enrichment, i.e., of a formation mechanism that implies multiple generations of stars. Here we concentrate on the old, massive, metal-rich OC NGC 6791. We analyzed archival Keck/HIRES spectra of 15 NGC 6791 main-sequence turnoff and evolved stars, concentrating on the derivation of C, N, O, and Na abundances. We also used WIYN/Hydra spectra of 21 evolved stars (one is in common). Given the spectral complexity of the very metal-rich NGC 6791 stars, we employed spectrum synthesis to measure most of the abundances. We confirmed the cluster super-solar metallicity and abundances of Ca and Ni that have been derived in past studies. More importantly, we did not detect any significant star-to-star abundance dispersion in C, N, O, and Na. Based on the absence of a clear Na-O anticorrelation, NGC 6791 can still be considered a true OC, hosting a single generation of stars and not a low-mass GC.},

The grids, which consist of tracks for masses from 0.12 \textbackslash,\{\textbackslash{}cal M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot \}\} to 1.1-1.5 \textbackslash,\{\textbackslash{}cal M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot \}\} (depending on the metallicity) are based on up-to-date physics, including the gravitational settling of helium (but not metals diffusion). Interpolation software is provided to generate isochrones for arbitrary ages between {$\approx$}5 and 15 Gyr and any values of Y, [{$\alpha$}/Fe], and [Fe/H] within the aformentioned ranges. Comparisons of isochrones with published color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for the open clusters M67 ([Fe/H] {$\approx$}0.0) and NGC 6791 ([Fe/H] {$\approx$}0.3) and for four of the metal-poor globular clusters (47 Tuc, M3, M5, and M92) indicate that the models for the observed metallicities do a reasonably good job of reproducing the locations and slopes of the cluster main sequences and giant branches. The same conclusion is reached from a consideration of plots of nearby subdwarfs that have accurate Hipparcos parallaxes and metallicities in the range -2.0 \&lt;\textasciitilde{} [Fe/H] \&lt;\textasciitilde{} -1.0 on various CMDs and on the (log T \textsubscript{eff}, M\textsubscript{V} ) diagram. A relatively hot temperature scale similar to that derived in recent calibrations of the infrared flux method is favored by both the isochrones and the adopted color transformations, which are based on the latest MARCS model atmospheres.},

  abstract = {We present two absolute magnitude calibrations for dwarfs based on colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic clusters. The combination of the M\textsubscript{g} absolute magnitudes of the dwarf fiducial sequences of the clusters M92, M13, M5, NGC 2420, M67, and NGC 6791 with the corresponding metallicities provides absolute magnitude calibration for a given (g - r)\textsubscript{0} colour. The calibration is defined in the colour interval 0.25 {$\leq$} (g - r)\textsubscript{0} {$\leq$} 1.25 mag and it covers the metallicity interval - 2.15 {$\leq$} [Fe/H] {$\leq$} +0.37 dex. The absolute magnitude residuals obtained by the application of the procedure to another set of Galactic clusters lie in the interval - 0.15 {$\leq$} {$\increment$}M\textsubscript{g} {$\leq$} +0.12 mag. The mean and standard deviation of the residuals are \&lt; {$\increment$}M\textsubscript{g} \&gt; = - 0.002 and {$\sigma$} = 0.065 mag, respectively. The calibration of the M\textsubscript{J} absolute magnitude in terms of metallicity is carried out by using the fiducial sequences of the clusters M92, M13, 47 Tuc, NGC 2158, and NGC 6791. It is defined in the colour interval 0.90 {$\leq$} (V - J)\textsubscript{0} {$\leq$} 1.75 mag and it covers the same metallicity interval of the M\textsubscript{g} calibration. The absolute magnitude residuals obtained by the application of the procedure to the cluster M5 ([Fe/H] = -1.40 dex) and 46 solar metallicity, - 0.45 {$\leq$} [Fe/H] {$\leq$} +0.35 dex, field stars lie in the interval - 0.29 and + 0.35 mag. However, the range of 87\% of them is rather shorter, - 0.20 {$\leq$} {$\increment$}M\textsubscript{J} {$\leq$} +0.20 mag. The mean and standard deviation of all residuals are \&lt; {$\increment$}M\textsubscript{J} \&gt; =0.05 and {$\sigma$} = 0.13 mag, respectively. The derived relations are applicable to stars older than 4 Gyr for the M\textsubscript{g} calibration, and older than 2 Gyr for the M\textsubscript{J} calibration. The cited limits are the ages of the youngest calibration clusters in the two systems.},

  abstract = {Membership determination is the key-important step to study open clusters, which can directly influence on the estimation of open clusters' physical parameters. DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm in data mining techniques. In this paper the DBSCAN algorithm has been used for the first time to make the membership determination of the open clusters NGC 6791 and M 67 (NGC 2682). Our results indicate that the DBSCAN algorithm can effectively eliminate the contamination of field stars. The obtained member stars of NGC 6791 exhibit clearly a doubled main-sequence structure in the color-magnitude diagram, implying that NGC 6791 may have a more complicated history of star formation and evolution. The clustering analysis of M67 indicates the presence of mass segregation, and the distinct relative motion between the central part and the outer part of the cluster. These results demonstrate that the DBSCAN algorithm is an effective method of membership determination, and that it has some advantages superior to the conventional kinematic method.},

For these stars, the pulsations are driven by the opacity bump of Fe-group elements at around 200,000 K in the stellar envelope. For \$\textbackslash{}delta\$ Scuti pulsations in A-type stars, pulsations are driven instead by the \$\textbackslash{}kappa\$ effect in the second helium ionization region at around 50,000 K. Opacity modifications investigated for B-type stars may also have an effect on the structure of A-type stars and the instability region. Studies of the pulsation instability region for A-type stars show that other factors also influence the pulsations, for example, helium abundance and diffusive settling. Here we explore some of these effects, focusing on modeling of A-type stars. We compare results using the new LANL OPLIB vs. LLNL OPAL opacities for the AGSS09 solar abundance mixture. We comment on prospects for using BRITE observations of A-type stars to constrain opacities.},

We present the asteroseismic diagrams of the asymptotic parameters {$\delta\nu$} 02 , {$\delta\nu$} 01 , and \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/epsi.gif] epsilon , which show clear correlation with fundamental stellar parameters such as mass and radius. When the stellar populations from the clusters are compared, we see evidence for a difference in mass of the red giant branch stars and possibly a difference in structure of the red clump stars, from our measurements of the small separations {$\delta\nu$} 02 and {$\delta\nu$} 01 . Ensemble {\'e}chelle diagrams and upper limits to the linewidths of {$\mathscr{l}$} = 0 modes as a function of {$\Delta\nu$} of the clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 6819 are also shown, together with the correlation between the {$\mathscr{l}$} = 0 ridge width and the T eff of the stars. Lastly, we distinguish between red giant branch and red clump stars through the measurement of the period spacing of mixed dipole modes in 53 stars among all the three clusters to verify the stellar classification from the color-magnitude diagram. These seismic results also allow us to identify a number of special cases, including evolved blue stragglers and binaries, as well as stars in late He-core burning phases, which can be potentially interesting targets for detailed theoretical modeling.},

Following a first discussion of NGC 6791 observations in an accompanying paper, here we complete our analysis, also presenting for NGC 6819 and NGC 7142 the first-ever U CCD photometry. The color\textendash{}magnitude diagram of the three clusters is analyzed in detail, with special emphasis on the hot stellar component. We report, in this regard, one new extreme horizontal-branch star candidate in NGC 6791. For NGC 6819 and 7142, the stellar luminosity function clearly points to a looser radial distribution of faint lower main sequence stars, either as a consequence of cluster dynamical interaction with the Galaxy or as an effect of an increasing fraction of binary stars toward the cluster core, as also observed in NGC 6791. Compared to a reference theoretical model for the Galaxy disk, the analysis of the stellar field along the line of sight of each cluster indicates that a more centrally concentrated thick disk, on a scale length shorter than {$\sim$}2.8 kpc, might better reconcile the lower observed fraction of bright field stars and their white-dwarf progeny.},

  abstract = {Almost all globular clusters investigated exhibit a spread in their light element abundances, the most studied being an Na:O anticorrelation. In contrast, open clusters show a homogeneous composition and are still regarded as Simple Stellar Populations. The most probable reason for this difference is that globulars had an initial mass high enough to retain primordial gas and ejecta from the first stellar generation and thus formed a second generation with a distinct composition, an initial mass exceeding that of open clusters. NGC 6791 is a massive open cluster and warrants a detailed search for chemical inhomogeneities. We collected high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of 21 members covering a wide range of evolutionary status and measured their Na, O, and Fe content. We found [Fe/H] = +0.42 {$\pm$} 0.01, in good agreement with previous values, and no evidence for a spread. However, the Na:O distribution is completely unprecedented. It becomes the first open cluster to show intrinsic abundance variations that cannot be explained by mixing, and thus the first discovered to host multiple populations. It is also the first star cluster to exhibit two subpopulations in the Na:O diagram with one being chemically homogeneous while the second has an intrinsic spread that follows the anticorrelation so far displayed only by globular clusters. NGC 6791 is unique in many aspects, displaying certain characteristics typical of open clusters, others more reminiscent of globulars, and yet others, in particular its Na:O behavior investigated here, that are totally unprecedented. It clearly had a complex and fascinating history.},

The combination of the absolute magnitude offset from the fiducial of giant sequence of the cluster M5 with the corresponding metallicity offset provides a calibration estimation for the absolute magnitude of red giants for a given (B \textendash{} V)0 colour. The calibration is defined in the colour interval 0.75 {$\leq$} (B \textendash{} V)0 {$\leq$} 1.50 mag and it covers the metal licity interval -2.15 {$>$} [Fe/H]{$\leq$}+0.37 dex. 91\% of the absolute magnitude residuals obtained by the application of the procedure to another set of Galactic clusters lie in the interval -0.40 {$<$} {$\Delta$}M{$\leq$}+0.40 mag. The mean and the standard deviation of the residuals are 0.05 and 0.19 mag, respectively. We fitted the absolute magnitude also to metallicity and age for a limited sub-sample of (B \textendash{} V)0 colour, just to test the effect of age in absolute-magnitude calibration. Comparison of the mean and the standard deviation of the residuals evaluated by this procedure with the corresponding ones provided by the procedure where the absolute magnitude fitted to a third degree polynomial of metallicity show that the age parameter may be omitted in absolute magnitude estimation of red giants. The derived relations are applicable to stars older than 4 Gyr, the age of the youngest calibrating cluster.},

It is located inside the solar circle, harbors a large population of binary stars, and possibly experienced prolonged star formation. The combination of all these properties is puzzling and poses the intriguing question of its origin.\emph{Aims.\emph{ One possible scenario is that the cluster formed close to the Galactic Center and later migrated outward to its current location. In this work we study the cluster's orbit and investigate the possible migration processes that may have displaced NGC 6791 to its present-day position, under the assumption that it actually formed in the inner disk.\emph{Methods.\emph{ To this aim we performed integrations of NGC 6791's orbit in a potential consistent with the main Milky Way parameters. In addition to analytical expressions for halo, bulge and disk, we also consider the effect of bar and spiral arm perturbations, which are expected to be very important for the disk dynamical evolution, especially inside the solar circle. Starting from state-of-the art initial conditions for NGC 6791, we calculated 1000 orbits back in time for about 1 Gyr turning different non-axisymmetric components of the global potential on and off.

We caution that if the expansion velocity and dust-to-gas ratio have different values from those assumed, the constants in the fit will change. If these parameters are also functions of luminosity, then this would affect both the slopes and the offsets. The mass-loss rates are compared to those derived for luminous stars in globular clusters, by fitting both the infrared excess, as in the present paper, and the chromospheric lines. There is excellent agreement between these values and the mass-loss rates derived from the chromospheric activity. There is a systematic difference with the literature mass-loss rates derived from modelling the infrared excess, and this has been traced to technical details on how the DUSTY radiative transfer model is run. If the present results are combined with those from modelling the chromospheric emission lines, we obtain the fits log \emph{{\.M}\emph{ (\emph{M\emph{\textsubscript{{$\odot$}\textsubscript{ yr\textsuperscript{-1\textsuperscript{) = (1.0 {$\pm$} 0.3)log \emph{L\emph{ + (-12.0 {$\pm$} 0.9) and log \emph{{\.M}\emph{ (\emph{M\emph{\textsubscript{{$\odot$}\textsubscript{ yr\textsuperscript{-1\textsuperscript{) = (0.6 {$\pm$} 0.2)log (\emph{LR\emph{/\emph{M\emph{) + (-11.9 {$\pm$} 0.9), and find that the metallicity dependence is weak at best. The predictions of these mass-loss rate formula are tested against the recent RGB mass loss determination in NGC 6791. Using a scaling factor of \textasciitilde{}10 {$\pm$} \textasciitilde{}5, both relations can fit this value. That the scaling factor is larger than unity suggests that the expansion velocity and/or dust-to-gas ratio, or even the dust opacities, are different from the values adopted.

  abstract = {The Galactic population of Open Clusters provides an insight into star formation in the Galaxy. The open cluster catalogue by Dias et al. Astron. Astrophys. 389, 871 (2002) is a rich source of data, including kinematic information. This large sample made it possible to carry out a systematic analysis of 481 open cluster orbits, using parameters based on orbit eccentricity and separation from the Galactic plane. These two parameters may be indicative of origin, and we find them to be correlated. We also find them to be correlated with metallicity, another parameter suggested elsewhere to be a marker for origin in that high values of any of these two parameters generally indicate a low metallicity ([Fe/H] Solar{$<-$}0.2dex). The resulting analysis points to four open clusters in the catalogue being of extra-Galactic origin by impact of high velocity cloud on the disk: Berkeley21, 32, 99, and Melotte66, with a possible further four due to this origin (NGC2158, 2420, 7789, IC1311). A further three may be due to Galactic globular cluster impact on the disk i.e of internal Galactic origin (NGC6791, 1817, and 7044).},

  abstract = {Metallicity is one of four free parameters typically considered when fitting isochrones to the cluster sequence. Unfortunately, this parameter is often ignored or assumed to be solar in most papers. Hence an unknown bias is introduced in the estimation of the other three cluster parameters (age, reddening and distance). Furthermore, studying the metallicity of open clusters allows us not only to derive the Galactic abundance gradient on a global scale, but also to trace the local solar environment in more detail. In a series of three papers, we investigate the current status of published metallicities for open clusters from widely different photometric and spectroscopic methods. A detailed comparison of the results allows us to establish more reliable photometric calibrations and corrections for isochrone fitting techniques. Well established databases such as WEBDA help us to perform a homogeneous analysis of available measurements for a significant number of open clusters. The literature was searched for [Fe/H] estimates on the basis of photometric calibrations in any available filter system. On the basis of results published by Tadross, we demonstrate the caveats of the calibration choice and its possible impact. In total, we find 406 individual metallicity values for 188 open clusters within 64 publications. The values were, finally, unweightedly averaged. Our final sample includes [Fe/H] values for 188 open clusters. Tracing the solar environment within 4000x4000 pc**2 we identify a patchy metallicity distribution as an extension to the Local Bubble that significantly influences the estimation of the Galactic metallicity gradient, even on a global scale. In addition, further investigations of more distant open clusters are clearly needed to obtain a more profound picture at Galactocentric distances beyond 10 000 pc.},

  title = {On the Metallicity of Open Clusters},
  abstract = {Methods. The literature was searched for [Fe/H] estimates of individual member stars of open clusters based on the analysis of highresolution spectra. For comparison, we also compiled [Fe/H] estimates based on spectra with low and intermediate resolution. At medium and high resolution, we found that differences in the analysis methods have a stronger effect on the metallicity than that of quality differences in the observations. We retained only highly probable cluster members and introduced a restriction on atmospheric parameters.
Results. We combined 641 individual metallicity values for 458 stars in 78 open clusters from 86 publications to form our final set of high-quality cluster metallicities. The photometric metallicities discussed in the first paper of this series are systematically lower than the spectroscopic ones by about 0.1 dex, and the differences show a scatter of about 0.2 dex. In a preliminary comparison of our spectroscopic sample with models of Galactic chemical evolution, none of the models predicts the observed radial metallicity gradient.
Conclusions. Photometric metallicities show a large intrinsic dispersion, while the more accurate spectroscopic sample presented in this paper comprises fewer than half the number of clusters. Only a sophisticated combination of all available photometric and spectroscopic data will allow us to trace the metallicity distribution in the Galactic disk on a local and global scale.},

  title = {On the Metallicity of Open Clusters},
  abstract = {Methods. We used photometric and spectroscopic data to derive cluster metallicities. The different sources were checked and tested for possible offsets and correlations.
Results. In total, metallicities for 172 open cluster were derived. We used the spectroscopic data of 100 objects for a study of the radial metallicity distribution and the age-metallicity relation. We found a possible increase of metallicity with age, which, if confirmed, would provide observational evidence for radial migration. Although a statistical significance is given, more studies are certainly needed to exclude selection effects, for example. The comparison of open clusters and Cepheids with recent Galactic models agrees well in general. However, the models do not reproduce the flat gradient of the open clusters in the outer disc. Thus, the effect of radial migration is either underestimated in the models, or an additional mechanism is at work.
Conclusions. Apart from the Cepheids, open clusters are the best tracers for metallicity over large Galactocentric distances in the Milky Way. For a sound statistical analysis, a sufficiently large and homogeneous sample of cluster metallicities is needed. Our compilation is currently by far the largest and provides the basis for several basic studies such as the statistical treatment of the Galactic cluster population, or evolutionary studies of individual star groups in open clusters.},

  abstract = {We present the results of an analysis of photometric time-series observations for NGC 2126 acquired during the years 2004, 2013, and 2015. NGC 2126 is an intermediate-age open cluster which has a population of stars inside the {$\delta$} Scuti instability strip. The main purpose is to search for new variable stars, to study their light curves and pulsation spectra. Eleven variables are reported, two of which are new discoveries, eight are pulsating and three eclipsing binary stars, one of which has a pulsating component (V551 Aur). Our 10 times of light minimum along with others compiled from the literature were used to revise the orbital period of V551 Aur: Porb = 1.1731752(8) d. The Wilson\textendash{}Devinney technique was used to analyse its light curves and to determine a new set of the system's parameters. We found a single pulsation period Ppul = 0.12964977(3) d in the residuals which lies near the 9th harmonic of the orbital period. We determined the accurate value of high proper motion star LHS 1809 as {$\mu\alpha$}cos {$\delta$} = 115.7{$\pm$} 0.1 mas yr-1 and {$\mu\delta$} = -823.7 {$\pm$} 0.1 mas yr-1. From the construction of the colour\textendash{}magnitude diagram, we estimated the physical parameters of the cluster. We found that the shape of the colour\textendash{}magnitude diagram at the turn-off point is well reproduced with an isochrone with log(t) of 9.1 {$\pm$} 0.1 yr, metallicity of 0.019, E(B - V) = 0.27{$\pm$} 0.01 mag, and (m - M)0 = 10.80 {$\pm$} 0.05 mag.},

  abstract = {Within the variety of objects populating stellar clusters, blue straggler stars (BSSs) are among the most puzzling ones. BSSs are commonly found in globular clusters, but they are also known to populate open clusters of the Milky Way. Two main theoretical scenarios (collisions and mass transfer) have been suggested to explain their formation, although finding observational evidence in support of either scenario represents a challenging task. Among the APOGEE observations of the old open cluster M67, we found 8 BSS candidates known from the literature and two known evolved BSSs. We carried out a chemical analysis of 3 BSS candidates and of the 2 evolved BSSs out of the sample and found that the BSS candidates have surface abundances similar to those of stars on the main-sequence turn-off of M67. Especially the absence of any anomaly in their carbon abundances seems to support a collisional formation scenario for these stars. Furthermore, we note that the abundances of the evolved BSSs S1040 and S1237 are consistent with the abundances of the red clump stars of M67. In particular, they show a depletion in carbon by {$\sim$} 0.25 dex, which could be either interpreted as the signature of mass transfer or as the product of stellar evolutionary processes. Finally, we summarise the properties of the individual BSS stars observed by APOGEE, as derived from their APOGEE spectra and/or from information available in the literature.},

  abstract = {The Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey is a large-scale stellar spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way, designed to deliver complementary chemical information to a large number of stars covered by the Gaia mission. We present the GALAH second public data release (GALAH DR2) containing 342 682 stars. For these stars, the GALAH collaboration provides stellar parameters and abundances for up to 23 elements to the community. Here we present the target selection, observation, data reduction, and detailed explanation of how the spectra were analysed to estimate stellar parameters and element abundances. For the stellar analysis, we have used a multistep approach. We use the physics-driven spectrum synthesis of Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) to derive stellar labels (Teff, log g, [Fe/H], [X/Fe], vmic, vsin i, AKS ) for a representative training set of stars. This information is then propagated to the whole sample with the data-driven method of The Cannon. Special care has been exercised in the spectral synthesis to only consider spectral lines that have reliable atomic input data and are little affected by blending lines. Departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) are considered for several key elements, including Li, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, and Fe, using 1D MARCS stellar atmosphere models. Validation tests including repeat observations, Gaia benchmark stars, open and globular clusters, and K2 asteroseismic targets lend confidence to our methods and results. Combining the GALAH DR2 catalogue with the kinematic information from Gaia will enable a wide range of Galactic Archaeology studies, with unprecedented detail, dimensionality, and scope.},

  abstract = {Stars observed in the field of an open cluster are ideal for a controlled test of chemical tagging. Using chemical tagging, one should identify the cluster members, i.e., those stars of similar chemical composition, if their composition is indeed different from that of all the nonmember stars of the field. Moreover, the abundance-based membership can be checked against membership based on radial velocities and proper motions. Here, I report preliminary results of such an experiment using data from the Gaia-ESO Survey. Although the three membership criteria usually agree, a few interesting examples of discrepant membership classification have been found. In addition, the mean composition of each open cluster was compared to a sample of 1 600 Gaia-ESO field stars. Some cases of field stars with abundances matching those of the open clusters were identified. This experiment suggests that open clusters do not necessarily have unique abundance patterns that set them apart from all other clusters.},

We derived stellar parameters and differential chemical abundances for 19 elements (C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Ba) with uncertainties as low as {$\sim$}0.01\textendash{}0.02 dex. Our main results include: (1) there is no clear chemical signature of planet formation detected among the sample stars, i.e. no correlations in abundances versus condensation temperature; (2) the observed abundance dispersions are a factor of {$\approx$}1.5\textendash{}2 larger than the average measurement errors for most elements; (3) there are positive correlations, of high statistical significance, between the abundances of at least 90 per cent of pairs of elements. We demonstrate that none of these findings can be explained by errors due to the stellar parameters. Our results reveal that the Hyades is chemically inhomogeneous at the 0.02 dex level. Possible explanations for the abundance variations include (1) inhomogeneous chemical evolution in the proto-cluster environment, (2) supernova ejection in the proto-cluster cloud and (3) pollution of metal-poor gas before complete mixing of the proto-cluster cloud. Our results provide significant new constraints on the chemical composition of open clusters and a challenge to the current view of Galactic archaeology.},

  title = {{{THE CHEMICAL HOMOGENEITY OF OPEN CLUSTERS}}},
  abstract = {Determining the level of chemical homogeneity in open clusters is of fundamental importance in the study of the evolution of star-forming clouds and that of the Galactic disk. Yet limiting the initial abundance spread in clusters has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining consistent spectroscopic abundances for different stellar types. Without reference to any specific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a homogeneous cluster is that it forms a one-dimensional sequence, with any differences between members due to variations in stellar mass and observational uncertainties. I present a novel method for investigating the abundance spread in open clusters that tests this one-dimensional hypothesis at the level of observed stellar spectra, rather than constraining homogeneity using derived abundances as is traditionally done. Using high-resolution APOGEE spectra for 49 giants in M67, NGC 6819, and NGC 2420 I demonstrate that these spectra form one-dimensional sequences for each cluster. With detailed forward modeling of the spectra and Approximate Bayesian Computation, I derive strong limits on the initial abundance spread of 15 elements: {$<$}0.01 (0.02) dex for C and Fe, 0.015 (0.03) dex for N, O, Mg, Si, and Ni, 0.02 (0.03) dex for Al, Ca, and Mn, and 0.03 (0.05) dex for Na, S, K, Ti, and V (at 68\% and 95\% confidence, respectively). The strong limits on C and O imply that no pollution by massive core-collapse supernovae occurred during star formation in open clusters, which, thus, need to form within 6 Myr. Further development of this and related techniques will bring the power of differential abundances to stars other than solar twins in large spectroscopic surveys and will help unravel the history of star formation and chemical enrichment in the Milky Way through chemical tagging.},

The second Gaia data release contains precise astrometry at the sub-milliarcsecond level and homogeneous photometry at the mmag level, that can be used to characterise a large number of clusters over the entire sky. In this study we aim to a establish list of members and derive mean parameters, in particular distances, for as many clusters as possible, making use of Gaia data alone. We compile a list of thousands of known or putative clusters from the literature. We then apply an unsupervised membership assignment code, UPMASK, to the Gaia DR2 data contained within the fields of those clusters. We obtained a list of members and cluster parameters for 1229 clusters. As expected, the youngest clusters are seen to be tightly distributed near the Galactic plane and to trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way, while older objects are more uniformly distributed, deviate further from the plane, and tend to be located at larger Galactocentric distances. Thanks to the quality of GaiaDR2 astrometry, the fully homogeneous parameters derived in this study are the most precise to date. Furthermore, we report on the serendipitous discovery of 60 new open clusters in the fields analysed during this study.},

An unprobed assumption of this field is that the chemical composition of a star is an immutable marker of the gas from which it formed. It is vital to test this assumption on open clusters, group of stars formed from the same gas. Previous investigations have shown that unevolved stars in clusters are chemically homogeneous within the typical uncertainties of these analysis, i.e. 15\$\textbackslash\%\$ of the elemental abundances. Our strictly differential analysis on five members of the Pleiades allows us to reach precisions of 5\$\textbackslash\%\$ for most elements and to unveil chemical anomalies within the cluster that could be explained by planet engulfment events. These results reveal that the evolution of planetary systems may alter the chemical composition of stars, challenging our capability of tagging them to their native environments, and also paving the way for the study of planetary architectures and their evolution, through the chemical pattern of their host stars.},

Thanks to the large red giant sample, we confirm that red-giant-branch (RGB) and helium-core-burning (HeB) stars collectively differ in the distribution of oscillation amplitude, granulation power, and width of power excess, which is mainly due to the mass difference. The distribution of oscillation amplitudes shows an extremely sharp upper edge at fixed \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0067-0049/236/2/42/apjsaaaf74ieqn9.gif] \$\textbackslash{}nu \_\textbackslash{}max \$ , which might hold clues for understanding the excitation and damping mechanisms of the oscillation modes. We find that both oscillation amplitude and granulation power depend on metallicity, causing a spread of 15\% in oscillation amplitudes and a spread of 25\% in granulation power from [Fe/H] = -0.7 to 0.5 dex. Our asteroseismic stellar properties can be used as reliable distance indicators and age proxies for mapping and dating galactic stellar populations observed by Kepler . They will also provide an excellent opportunity to test asteroseismology using Gaia parallaxes, and lift degeneracies in deriving atmospheric parameters in large spectroscopic surveys such as APOGEE and LAMOST.},

We elaborate further on the deep learning method by developing an improved convolutional neural network classifier. To make our method useful for current and future space missions such as K2, TESS, and PLATO, we train classifiers that are able to classify the evolutionary states of lower frequency resolution spectra expected from these missions. Additionally, we provide new classifications for 8633 Kepler red giants, out of which 426 have previously not been classified using asteroseismology. This brings the total to 14983 Kepler red giants classified with our new neural network. We also verify that our classifiers are remarkably robust to suboptimal data, including low signal-to-noise and incorrect training truth labels.},

Such seismic measurements remained rather scarce for hot B subdwarf (sdB) stars until the advent of space observations with the Kepler spacecraft. Nowadays, however, a number of rotation measurements have become available, offering a glimpse on the global rotational properties of sdB stars. Here, we briefly discuss what asteroseismology starts to reveal on the rotation rate of these stars. We also make connections with the internal rotation of red-giant and white-dwarf stars. In particular, we show that the very slow rotation rates derived for single sdB stars, and their similarities with the dynamical properties of the cores of red-clump stars, strongly suggest that they evolved from red-giants rather than merger events.We also point out that no more angular momentum seems to be lost by stellar cores throughout the helium burning phase until the cooling white-dwarf stage, indicating that all the braking occurs before, most likely during red-giant branch evolution.},

Recently, Hawkins et al. demonstrated that the additional information in single-epoch spectra, such as the C/N ratio, can be exploited to cleanly differentiate RC and RGB stars. In this second paper of the series, we establish a data-driven mapping from spectral flux space to independently determined asteroseismic parameters, the frequency and the period spacing. From this, we identify 210,371 RC stars from the publicly available LAMOST DR3 and APOGEE DR14 data, with {$\sim$}9\% of contamination. We provide an RC sample of 92249 stars with a contamination of only {$\sim$}3\%, by restricting the combined analysis to LAMOST stars with S/N pix {$\geq$} 75. This demonstrates that high-signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), low-resolution spectra covering a broad wavelength range can identify RC samples at least as pristine as their high-resolution counterparts. As coming and ongoing surveys such as TESS, DESI, and LAMOST will continue to improve the overlapping training spectroscopic-asteroseismic sample, the method presented in this study provides an efficient and straightforward way to derive a vast yet pristine sample of RC stars to reveal the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Milky Way.},

  shorttitle = {Beyond {{Blue Stragglers}}},
  abstract = {Color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of open clusters reveal many stars that do not fall on standard isochrones, and thus are not evolving according to standard theory. The most numerous of these are the blue straggler stars (BSSs), stars brighter and bluer than the cluster turnoff that are likely formed from binary mass transfer, stellar mergers, or collisions during dynamical encounters. Many other non-standard stars are also found in fclusters, but their origins are not well understood. These include the `yellow stragglers' found between the BSS region and the red giant branch, and `sub-subgiants' found fainter and redder than the giant branch. Using the 4 Gyr open cluster M67 as an exemplar, I present results of the first comprehensive study to move beyond the BSS population and begin to understand these other types of non-standard stars. First, I present an asteroseismic analysis of a yellow straggler in M67, demonstrating that it is an evolved blue straggler star of twice the cluster turnoff mass. Next, I present theoretical formation models for the sub-subgiant stars. I focus on three hypotheses of sub-subgiant formation: Roche lobe overflow in binary systems, rapid envelope mass loss from subgiant stars, e.g. during grazing dynamical encounters, and inhibition of convection in giant stars with strong magnetic fields. Finally, I use K2 light curves to identify stars on the M67 main sequence with unusually fast rotation rates given the old age of the cluster. I hypothesize that these stars have been spun up due to recent mergers, collisions, or episodes of mass-transfer, and thus represent lower-luminosity analogs to the blue stragglers. Together, these studies present a much more complete view of the post-merger, collision, and mass-transfer population of M67, and demonstrate that BSSs account for only about half of the post-interaction population. These stars represent the early stages of binary evolution pathways that may lead to many astrophysically important objects including X-ray binaries, double degenerates, and Type 1a supernovae. Studying these products of binary evolution across cluster CMDs is a critical step towards developing better models of binary evolutionary pathways and understanding the impact of binaries on stellar populations.},

When we compare these data to theoretical predictions, we find a metallicity dependent temperature offset with a slope of around 100 K per dex in metallicity. We find that this effect is present in all model grids tested, and that theoretical uncertainties in the models, correlated spectroscopic errors, and shifts in the asteroseismic mass scale are insufficient to explain this effect. Stellar models can be brought into agreement with the data if a metallicity-dependent convective mixing length is used, with {$\Delta$} {$\alpha$} ML,YREC {$\sim$} 0.2 per dex in metallicity, a trend inconsistent with the predictions of three-dimensional stellar convection simulations. If this effect is not taken into account, isochrone ages for red giants from the Gaia data will be off by as much as a factor of two even at modest deviations from solar metallicity ([Fe/H] = -0.5).},

Here we report the first asteroseismic mass and radius measurements of such a star, the yellow straggler S1237 in the open cluster M67. We apply asteroseismic scaling relations to a frequency analysis of the Kepler K2 light curve and find a mass of2.9 {$\pm$} 0.2 M {$\odot$} and a radius of9.2 {$\pm$} 0.2 R {$\odot$} . This is more than twice the mass of the main-sequence turnoff in M67, suggesting that S1237 is indeed an evolved blue straggler. S1237 is the primary in a spectroscopic binary. We update the binary orbital solution and use spectral energy distribution fitting to constrain the CMD location of the secondary star. We find that the secondary is likely an upper main-sequence star near the turnoff, but a slightly hotter blue straggler companion is also possible. We then compare the asteroseismic mass of the primary to its mass from CMD fitting, finding that the photometry implies a mass and radius more than 2 {$\sigma$} below the asteroseismic measurement. Finally, we consider formation mechanisms for this star and suggest that S1237 may have formed from dynamical encounters resulting in stellar collisions or a binary merger.},

The open cluster M67 has a particularly important role as a calibration benchmark for stellar evolution theory due to its near-solar composition and age. As a result, it has been observed extensively, including attempts to detect solar-like oscillations in its main sequence and red giant stars.

Results. We measured the asymptotic period spacing for 1178 stars at various evolutionary stages. This allows us to monitor stellar evolution from the main sequence to the asymptotic giant branch and draw seismic evolutionary tracks. We present clear quantified asteroseismic definitions that characterize the change in the evolutionary stages, in particular the transition from the subgiant stage to the early red giant branch, and the end of the horizontal branch.
Conclusions. The seismic information is so precise that clear conclusions can be drawn independently of evolution models. The quantitative seismic information can now be used for stellar modeling, especially for studying the energy transport in the heliumburning core or for specifying the inner properties of stars entering the red or asymptotic giant branches. Modeling will also allow us to study stars that are identified to be in the helium-subflash stage, high-mass stars either arriving or quitting the secondary clump, or stars that could be in the blue-loop stage.},

  abstract = {Methods. We compute stretched spectra that mimic the regular pattern of pure dipole gravity modes. Mixed modes with the same azimuthal order are expected to be almost equally spaced in stretched period, with a spacing equal to the pure dipole gravity mode period spacing. The departure from this regular pattern allows us to disentangle the various rotational components and therefore to determine the mean core rotation rates of red giants.
Results. We automatically identify the rotational multiplet components of 1183 stars on the red giant branch with a success rate of 69\% with respect to our initial sample. As no information on the internal rotation can be deduced for stars seen pole-on, we obtain mean core rotation measurements for 875 red giant branch stars. This large sample includes stars with a mass as large as 2.5 M , allowing us to test the dependence of the core slow-down rate on the stellar mass.
Conclusions. Disentangling rotational splittings from mixed modes is now possible in an automated way for stars on the red giant branch, even for the most complicated cases, where the rotational splittings exceed half the mixed-mode spacing. This work on a large sample allows us to refine previous measurements of the evolution of the mean core rotation on the red giant branch. Rather than a slight slow-down, our results suggest rotation is constant along the red giant branch, with values independent of the mass.},

Once a red giant is sufficiently evolved, the helium in the core also undergoes fusion3. Outstanding issues in our understanding of red giants include uncertainties in the amount of mass lost at the surface before helium ignition and the amount of internal mixing from rotation and other processes4. Progress is hampered by our inability to distinguish between red giants burning helium in the core and those still only burning hydrogen in a shell. Asteroseismology offers a way forward, being a powerful tool for probing the internal structures of stars using their natural oscillation frequencies5. Here we report observations of gravity-mode period spacings in red giants6 that permit a distinction between evolutionary stages to be made. We use high-precision photometry obtained by the Kepler spacecraft over more than a year to measure oscillations in several hundred red giants. We find many stars whose dipole modes show sequences with approximately regular period spacings. These stars fall into two clear groups, allowing us to distinguish unambiguously between hydrogen-shell-burning stars (period spacing mostly {$\sim$}50 seconds) and those that are also burning helium (period spacing {$\sim$}100 to 300 seconds).},

Convection takes place over much of the star's radius. Conservation of angular momentum requires that the cores of these stars rotate faster than their envelopes; indirect evidence supports this1,2. Information about the angular-momentum distribution is inaccessible to direct observations, but it can be extracted from the effect of rotation on oscillation modes that probe the stellar interior. Here we report an increasing rotation rate from the surface of the star to the stellar core in the interiors of red giants, obtained using the rotational frequency splitting of recently detected `mixed modes'3,4. By comparison with theoretical stellar models, we conclude that the core must rotate at least ten times faster than the surface.

  title = {Probing the Core Structure and Evolution of Red Giants Using Gravity-Dominated Mixed Modes Observed with {{Kepler}}{$\star$}},
  abstract = {Methods. We propose two ways for describing the so-called mode bumping that affects the frequencies of the mixed modes. Firstly, a phenomenological approach is used to describe the main features of the mode bumping. Alternatively, a quasi-asymptotic mixed-mode relation provides a powerful link between seismic observations and the stellar interior structure. We used period {\'e}chelle diagrams to emphasize the detection of the gravity-dominated mixed modes.
Results. The asymptotic relation for mixed modes is confirmed. It allows us to measure the gravity-mode period spacings in more than two hundred red giant stars. The identification of the gravity-dominated mixed modes allows us to complete the identification of all major peaks in a red giant oscillation spectrum, with significant consequences for the true identification of = 3 modes, of = 2 mixed modes, for the mode widths and amplitudes, and for the = 1 rotational splittings.
Conclusions. The accurate measurement of the gravity-mode period spacing provides an effective probe of the inner, g-mode cavity. The derived value of the coupling coefficient between the cavities is different for red giant branch and clump stars. This provides a probe of the hydrogen-shell burning region that surrounds the helium core. Core contraction as red giants ascend the red giant branch can be explored using the variation of the gravity-mode spacing as a function of the mean large separation.},

The ground-based follow-up spectroscopy showed that this system is a double-lined spectroscopic binary, with a mass ratio close to unity. However, the fundamental parameters of the components of this system as well as their lithium abundances differ substantially. \emph{Kepler\emph{ photometry of this system allows to perform a detailed seismic analysis as well as to derive the orbital period and the surface rotation rate of the primary component of the system. Indications of the seismic signature of the secondary are found. The differing parameters are best explained with both components located in the early and the late phase of the first dredge up at the bottom of the red-giant branch. Observed lithium abundances in both components are in good agreement with prediction of stellar models including rotational mixing. By combining observations and theory, a comprehensive picture of the system can be drawn.}}}}}}},

  title = {The {{First APOKASC Catalog}} of {{Kepler Dwarf}} and {{Subgiant Stars}}},
  abstract = {We present the first APOKASC catalog of spectroscopic and asteroseismic data for dwarfs and subgiants. Asteroseismic data for our sample of 415 objects have been obtained by the Kepler mission in short (58.5s) cadence, and light curves span from 30 up to more than 1000days. The spectroscopic parameters are based on spectra taken as part of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and correspond to Data Release 13 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We analyze our data using two independent Teff scales, the spectroscopic values from DR13 and those derived from SDSS griz photometry. We use the differences in our results arising from these choices as a test of systematic temperature uncertainties and find that they can lead to significant differences in the derived stellar properties. Determinations of surface gravity (log g), mean density ({\'a}r{\~n}), radius (R), mass (M), and age ({$\tau$}) for the whole sample have been carried out by means of (stellar) grid-based modeling. We have thoroughly assessed random and systematic error sources in the spectroscopic and asteroseismic data, as well as in the grid-based modeling determination of the stellar quantities provided in the catalog. We provide stellar properties determined for each of the two Teff scales. The median combined (random and systematic) uncertainties are 2\% (0.01 dex; log g), 3.4\% ({\'a}r{\~n}), 2.6\% (R), 5.1\% (M), and 19\% ({$\tau$}) for the photometric Teff scale and 2\% (log g), 3.5\% ({\'a}r{\~n}), 2.7\% (R), 6.3\% (M), and 23\% ({$\tau$}) for the spectroscopic scale. We present comparisons with stellar quantities in the asteroseismic catalog by Chaplin et al. that highlight the importance of having metallicity measurements for determining stellar parameters accurately. Finally, we compare our results with those coming from a variety of sources, including stellar radii determined from TGAS parallaxes and asteroseismic analyses based on individual frequencies. We find a very good agreement for all inferred quantities. The latter comparison, in particular, gives strong support to the determination of stellar quantities based on global seismology, a relevant result for future missions such as TESS and PLATO.},

  title = {Global Survey of Star Clusters in the {{Milky Way}}},
  abstract = {Context. Although they are the main constituents of the Galactic disk population, for half of the open clusters in the Milky Way reported in the literature nothing is known except the raw position and an approximate size. Aims. The main goal of this study is to determine a full set of uniform spatial, structural, kinematic, and astrophysical parameters for as many known open clusters as possible. Methods. On the basis of stellar data from PPMXL and 2MASS, we used a dedicated data-processing pipeline to determine kinematic and photometric membership probabilities for stars in a cluster region. Results. For an input list of 3784 targets from the literature, we confirm that 3006 are real objects, the vast majority of them are open clusters, but associations and globular clusters are also present. For each confirmed object we determined the exact position of the cluster centre, the apparent size, proper motion, distance, colour excess, and age. For about 1500 clusters, these basic astrophysical parameters have been determined for the first time. For the bulk of the clusters we also derived the tidal radius. We estimated additionally average radial velocities for more than 30\% of the confirmed clusters. The present sample (called MWSC) reaches both the central parts of the Milky Way and its outer regions. It is almost complete up to 1.8 kpc from the Sun and also covers neighbouring spiral arms. However, for a small subset of the oldest open clusters (log t 9) we found some evidence of incompleteness within about 1 kpc from the Sun.},

We therefore confirm that NGC 6791 is extremely metal-rich, exhibits a few marginally subsolar abundance ratios, and within the resolution of our spectra does not show evidence of spread in metal abundance. With these new data we rederive the fundamental cluster parameters, suggesting that it is about 8 Gyr old and 4.3 kpc from the Sun. The combination of its chemical properties, age, position, and Galactic orbit hardly makes NGC 6791 a genuine Population I open cluster. We discuss possible interpretations of the cluster peculiarities, suggesting that the cluster might be what remains of a much larger system whose initial potential well could have been sufficient to produce high-metallicity stars and which has been depopulated by the tidal field of the Galaxy. Alternatively, its current properties may be explained by the perturbation of the Galactic bar on an object that originated well inside the solar ring, where the metal enrichment was very fast.},

We find that these parameters and the stellar age influence observables in qualitatively distinctive, degeneracy-breaking ways.

Although there is no obvious tension between the existing observations and the MIST models for NGC 6819, there are interesting discrepancies in the cases of M67 and NGC 6791. At this time, parallax zero-point uncertainties in Gaia DR2 remain one of the limiting factors in the analysis of these clusters.

  abstract = {Stars originate by the gravitational collapse of a turbulent molecular cloud of a diffuse medium, and are often observed to form clusters. Stellar clusters therefore play an important role in our understanding of star formation and of the dynamical processes at play. However, investigating the cluster formation is diffcult because the density of the molecular cloud undergoes a change of many orders of magnitude. Hierarchical-step approaches to decompose the problem into different stages are therefore required, as well as reliable assumptions on the initial conditions in the clouds. We report for the first time the use of the full potential of NASA \emph{Kepler\emph{ asteroseismic observations coupled with 3D numerical simulations, to put strong constraints on the early formation stages of open clusters. Thanks to a Bayesian peak bagging analysis of about 50 red giant members of NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, the two most populated open clusters observed in the nominal \emph{Kepler\emph{ mission, we derive a complete set of detailed oscillation mode properties for each star, with thousands of oscillation modes characterized. We therefore show how these asteroseismic properties lead us to a discovery about the rotation history of stellar clusters. Finally, our observational findings will be compared with hydrodynamical simulations for stellar cluster formation to constrain the physical processes of turbulence, rotation, and magnetic fields that are in action during the collapse of the progenitor cloud into a proto-cluster.}}}}},

Key to this time-stamping is the cluster NGC 6791, whose stellar members have mean abundances that place it in the high- {$\alpha$} , high-[Fe/H] region of the [ {$\alpha$} /Fe]\textendash{}[Fe/H] plane. Based on the cluster's age ({$\sim$}8 Gyr), Galactocentric radius, and height above the Galactic plane, as well as comparable chemistry reported for APOGEE stars in Baade's Window, we suggest that the two most likely origins for NGC 6791 are as an original part of the thick disk, or as a former member of the Galactic bulge. Moreover, because NGC 6791 lies at the high-metallicity end ([Fe/H] {$\sim$} 0.4) of the high- {$\alpha$} sequence, the age of NGC 6791 places a limit on the youngest age of stars in the high-metallicity, high- {$\alpha$} sequence for the cluster's parent population (i.e., either the bulge or the disk). In a similar way, we can also use the age and chemistry of NGC 188 to set a limit of {$\sim$}7 Gyr on the oldest age of the low- {$\alpha$} sequence of the MW. Therefore, NGC 6791 and NGC 188 are potentially a pair of star clusters that bracket both the timing and the duration of an important transition point in the chemical history of the MW.},

Radial velocity analysis confirms 39 stars consistent with single star membership, primarily at the turnoff. Thirty-six of these are included in our abundance analysis. Our differential analysis relative to the Sun yields primarily scaled-solar values, with weighted cluster averages of [O/H] = +0.440 {$\pm$} 0.020, [Fe/H] = +0.445 {$\pm$} 0.014, [Al/H] = +0.487 {$\pm$} 0.020, [Si/H] = +0.504 {$\pm$} 0.018, and [Ni/H] = +0.702 {$\pm$} 0.018 (where the errors are \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/149/4/141/aj510411ieqn1.gif] \$\textbackslash{}sigma \_\textbackslash{}mu \$ ). We discuss possible origins for the three known super-metal-rich clusters based upon their abundance patterns, Galactic locations, and space motions. The abundance patterns of NGC 6253 are very similar to those of NGC 6791 and NGC 6583. With the possible exception of oxygen, the abundances of these clusters are all close to scaled-solar, and they are similar to patterns seen in metal-rich disk dwarfs and giants. However, they also seem to differ from those of metal-rich bulge stars. We demonstrate that NGC 6253 is unusually oxygen rich (in [O/H]) for its 3.3 Gyr age. While we find [O/Fe] to be scaled-solar for NGC 6253, the more recently reported values for NGC 6791 show a large variation, from values close to scaled-solar down to values at least a factor of two below scaled-solar. We discuss the possibility that the scaled-solar [O/Fe] abundances of NGC 6253 and NGC 6791 might reflect a flattening of the Galactic [O/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relationship. This possibility may be consistent with disk star abundance data, which show an apparent ``floor'' at [O/Fe] \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/149/4/141/aj510411ieqn2.gif] \$\textbackslash{}sim -0.1\$ for [Fe/H] \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/149/4/141/aj510411ieqn3.gif] \$\textbackslash{}gt \textbackslash;0\$ , and with chemical evolution model results, which may predict such a flattening due to a decrease in supernova Fe yields at super-solar-metallicities. Orbit solutions for NGC 6791 allow that it may have formed in the inner disk and was then kicked out, but the origins of the other two much younger clusters remain mysterious. We re-evaluate the age of NGC 6583 in view of the evidence that the cluster is super-metal-rich, and confirm a probable age less than 1 Gyr (best range: 500\textendash{}900 Myr). We also argue that it is unlikely the cluster is more than 3 kpc away (best range: 2\textendash{}3 kpc) if the apparent turnoff, main sequence, and giants are all cluster members.},

As part of the WIYN Open Cluster Study, we present precise ({$\sigma$} = 0.38 km s \textendash{}1 ) radial velocities for proper motion candidate members of NGC 6791 from Platais et al. Our survey, extending down to g ' 16.8, is comprised of the evolved cluster population, including blue stragglers, giants, and horizontal branch stars. Of the 280 proper-motion-selected stars above our magnitude limit, 93\% have at least one radial velocity measurement and 79\% have three measurements over the course of at least 200 days, sufficient for secure radial-velocity-determined membership of non-velocity-variable stars. The Platais et al. proper motion catalog includes 12 anomalous horizontal branch candidates blueward of the red clump, of which we find only 4 to be cluster members. Three fall slightly blueward of the red clump and the fourth is consistent with being a blue straggler. The cleaned color-magnitude diagram shows a richly populated red giant branch and a blue straggler population. Half of the blue stragglers are in binaries. From our radial velocity measurement distribution, we find the cluster's radial velocity dispersion to be {$\sigma$} c = 0.62 {$\pm$} 0.10 km s \textendash{}1 .

  title = {Search for {{Binaries}} in the {{Extended Horizontal Branch}} of {{NGC}} 6791},
  abstract = {Extended horizontal branch (EHB) stars are common but poorly understood stars observed in the field (subdwarf B/O; sdB/sdO), in globular clusters, and in the metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791. These stars are very hot with extremely thin hydrogen-rich envelopes, which requires that they have undergone significant mass loss beyond that explained by models. A common theory is that their envelopes have been stripped by binary companions. While a majority of the field sdB stars are found to be short-period binaries, spectroscopically observed EHB stars in globular cluster are predominantly single stars. Does this suggest that their mechanisms of formation are distinct in these differing environments? We propose to test this by spectroscopically targeting the EHB stars in the open cluster NGC 6791. The nature of the EHB population in this cluster provides two potentially exciting results. If we find that the EHB stars are binaries, it suggests that in the significantly more dense environment of globulars their binarity has been disrupted. Otherwise, if we find they are singly evolved, this suggests that either the multiple populations observed in both environments or the very high metallicity, if not both, plays an important role. Multiple epochs of brief spectroscopic observations of these EHB stars in NGC 6791 will verify their cluster membership, detect if they are short period binaries, determine their v sin i, and be used to fit models for determining their stellar parameters.},

These common properties strengthen our ability to constrain stellar models and asteroseismically derived M , R , and g when tested against an ensemble of cluster stars.

From the analysis of these new relations we derive: (1) direct observational evidence that the masses of red giant branch stars in a cluster are the same within their uncertainties, (2) new methods to derive M and z of the cluster in a self-consistent way from {$\Delta\nu$} and {$\nu$} max , with lower intrinsic uncertainties, and (3) the mass dependence in the {$\Delta\nu$} - {$\nu$} max relation for red giant branch stars.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of the CN and CH molecular band strengths for cluster members of the open cluster NGC 6791 using low resolution (R \textasciitilde{} 2000) SEGUE spectra. The spectra were taken as part of the validation process for the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline (SSPP) and released in the eighth SDSS data release. If there are star-to-star abundance variations present at a given evolutionary state in a stellar population, they may be observed through variations in the molecular band strengths at that stage. Characterizing these variations in globular clusters has shown that the band strengths form a bimodal distribution, indicative of cluster members with different chemical abundances and possibly multiple generations of stars. In this work, we use this technique on an open cluster (NGC 6791) to address the possibility of abundance variations present in the cluster. Performing this analysis on other open clusters has resulted in unimodal distributions of CN and CH band strengths, as expected from their typical physical characteristics. NGC 6791, however, provides an interesting case study for this analysis due to its high mass \textasciitilde{}5 x 10 \textsubscript{4} solar masses, old age \textasciitilde{} 8 Gyr, and high metallicity [Fe/H] \textasciitilde{} +0.4 dex, making it a less than typical open cluster. For this reason, NGC 6791 has been the subject of other studies (see Twarog, et al. 2011; Geisler, et al. 2012; Carrera, 2012) focused on detecting abundance variations in the cluster using broadband photometry, high resolution spectra, and molecular band strengths. These studies have found some evidence for abundance variations among the cluster members, but there is still debate as to whether these findings are conclusive. In this study, we do not find evidence to support abundance variations between cluster members of NGC 6791.},

With follow-up optical spectroscopy, we confirm the nature of one CV. We discover one new, X-ray variable candidate CV with Balmer and He II emission lines in its optical spectrum; this is the first X-ray-selected CV in an open cluster. The number of CVs per unit mass is consistent with the field, suggesting that the 3-4 CVs observed in NGC 6791 are primordial. We compare the X-ray properties of NGC 6791 with those of a few old open (NGC 6819, M 67) and globular clusters (47 Tuc, NGC 6397). It is puzzling that the number of ABs brighter than 1 \texttimes{} 10 30 erg s \textendash{}1 normalized by cluster mass is lower in NGC 6791 than in M 67 by a factor 3-7. CVs, ABs, and sub-subgiants brighter than 1 \texttimes{} 10 30 erg s \textendash{}1 are under-represented per unit mass in the globular clusters compared to the oldest open clusters, and this accounts for the lower total X-ray luminosity per unit mass of the former. This indicates that the net effect of dynamical encounters may be the destruction of even some of the hardest (i.e., X-ray-emitting) binaries.},

  abstract = {We present a method for the determination of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] ratios from low-resolution ( R = 2000) SDSS/SEGUE stellar spectra. By means of a star-by-star comparison with degraded spectra from the ELODIE spectral library and with a set of moderately high-resolution ( R = 15, 000) and medium-resolution ( R = 6000) spectra of SDSS/SEGUE stars, we demonstrate that we are able to measure [{$\alpha$}/Fe] from SDSS/SEGUE spectra (with S/N{$>$}20/1) to a precision of better than 0.1 dex, for stars with atmospheric parameters in the range T eff = [4500, 7000] K, log g = [1.5, 5.0], and [Fe/H] = [\textendash{}1.4, +0.3], over the range [{$\alpha$}/Fe] = [\textendash{}0.1, +0.6]. For stars with [Fe/H] {$<$}\textendash{}1.4, our method requires spectra with slightly higher signal-to-noise to achieve this precision (S/N{$>$}25/1). Over the full temperature range considered, the lowest metallicity star for which a confident estimate of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] can be obtained from our approach is [Fe/H] \textendash{}2.5; preliminary tests indicate that a metallicity limit as low as [Fe/H] \textendash{}3.0 may apply to cooler stars. As a further validation of this approach, weighted averages of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] obtained for SEGUE spectra of likely member stars of Galactic globular clusters (M15, M13, and M71) and open clusters (NGC 2420, M67, and NGC 6791) exhibit good agreement with the values of [{$\alpha$}/Fe] from previous studies. The results of the comparison with NGC 6791 imply that the metallicity range for the method may extend to +0.5.},

Multiple binary stars provide the means to determine helium abundances in these old stellar systems, and in turn, to improve age estimates. \emph{Aims.\emph{ Earlier measurements of the masses and radii of the detached eclipsing binary V20 in the open cluster NGC 6791 were accurate enough to demonstrate that there are significant differences between current stellar models. Here we improve on those results and add measurements of two additional detached eclipsing binaries, the cluster members V18 and V80. The enlarged sample sets much tighter constraints on the properties of stellar models than has hitherto been possible, thereby improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age. \emph{Methods.\emph{ We employed (i) high-resolution UVES spectroscopy of V18, V20 and V80 to determine their spectroscopic effective temperatures, [Fe/H] values, and spectroscopic orbital elements; and (ii) time-series photometry from the Nordic Optical Telescope to obtain the photometric elements.\emph{Results.\emph{ The masses and radii of the V18 and V20 components are found to high accuracy, with errors on the masses in the range 0.27\textendash{}0.36\% and errors on the radii in the range 0.61\textendash{}0.92\%. V80 is found to be magnetically active, and more observations are needed to determine its parameters accurately. The metallicity of NGC 6791 is measured from disentangled spectra of the binaries and a few single stars to be [Fe/H] = +0.29 {$\pm$} 0.03 (random) {$\pm$}0.07 (systematic). The cluster reddening and apparent distance modulus are found to be \emph{E\emph{(\emph{B\emph{ - \emph{V\emph{) = 0.160 {$\pm$} 0.025 and (\emph{m\emph{ - \emph{M\emph{)\textsubscript{\emph{V\emph{\textsubscript{ = 13.51 {$\pm$} 0.06. A first model comparison shows that we can constrain the helium content of the NGC 6791 stars, and thus reach a more accurate age than previously possible. It may be possible to constrain additional parameters, in particular the C, N, and O abundances. This will be investigated in Paper II.\emph{Conclusions.\emph{ Using multiple, detached eclipsing binaries for determining stellar cluster ages, it is now possible to constrain parameters of stellar models, notably the helium content, which were previously out of reach.

Based upon radial-velocity measurements alone, 47 stars at the turnoff of the cluster color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and 18 giants are identified as potential members. Five turnoff stars exhibit evidence of binarity while proper-motion data eliminate two of the dwarfs as members. The mean cluster radial velocity from probable single-star members is \textendash{}29.4 {$\pm$} 1.3 km s \textendash{}1 (sd). A discussion of the current estimates for the cluster reddening, derived independently of potential issues with the BV cluster photometry, lead to an adopted reddening of E ( B \textendash{} V ) = 0.22 {$\pm$} 0.04. From equivalent width analyses of 38 probable single-star members near the CMD turnoff, the weighted average abundances are found to be [Fe/H] = +0.43 {$\pm$} 0.01, [Ni/H] = +0.53 {$\pm$} 0.02, and [Si/H] = +0.43 0.03 0.04 , where the errors refer to the standard errors of the weighted mean. Weak evidence is found for a possible decline in metallicity with increasing luminosity among stars at the turnoff. We discuss the possibility that our turnoff stars have been affected by microscopic diffusion. For 15 probable single-star members among the giants, spectrum synthesis leads to abundances of +0.46 0.02 0.03 for [Fe/H]. While NGC 6253 is less than half the age of NGC 6791, it is at least as metal-rich and, within the uncertainties, exhibits the same general abundance pattern as that typified by super-metal-rich dwarfs of the galactic bulge.},

  abstract = {The old open cluster NGC 6791 is believed to be more metal-rich than any other, yet several hot blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars are probable members. We have performed an abundance analysis of the coolest BHB candidate, 2-17, whose proper motion and radial velocity both support cluster membership. Its luminosity and its low rotational velocity, v sin i =16 {$\pm$} 1 km s -1 , suggest that it is a BHB star rather than a very luminous blue straggler. We find an effective temperature T eff =7300 {$\pm$} 50 K, gravity log g =3.6 {$\pm$} 0.3 dex, and an iron abundance more than twice solar, [Fe/H]=+0.4 {$\pm$} 0.1 dex. This result is free from the serious line blending and continuum suppression that hamper spectroscopic analyses of metal-rich giants. The Ca abundance is in the solar proportion with respect to iron, ruling out A-star peculiarities in 2-17. The relative abundances of C, O, and Al are nearly solar; mixing effects are probably small but not ruled out. The light elements Mg and Si are enhanced, N and Na especially so, as seen in metal-rich galaxies. NGC 6791 thus provides an excellent template for the study of the stellar content of metal-rich galactic systems. Both its abundances and its continued existence suggest that metal-rich systems might generally form in locally deep potential wells. Further study of its hot population should clarify the mechanisms responsible for producing hot stars in a metal-rich environment and thus assist the interpretation of the integrated light and the ultraviolet upturn in elliptical galaxies.},

We observed the second star, known as B7, to undergo a large ( 3 mag) drop in its brightness over 10 days. The spectrum of B7 obtained in the high state resembles spectra of nova-like CVs. This star is likely a member of the UX UMa subtypes of CVs. Variables B7 and B8 represent only the second and the third cataclysmic variables known in open clusters.

  abstract = {Three new photometric CCD-based datasets are presented for NGC\textasciitilde{}6791. They consist of deep UBV photometry (to \$V\_\{lim\} =24\$, \$B\_\{lim\}=24\$, \$U\_\{lim\} = 23\$) of the central parts of the cluster and of selected fields around it, and of relatively shallower UBVI photometry for the whole cluster (\$23' \textbackslash{}times 23'\$). The data have been used to discuss the reddening, metallicity and age ofNGC\textasciitilde{}6791, a cluster which is particularly important because of (1)\textasciitilde{}its most-advanced age among open clusters, (2)\textasciitilde{}metallicity higher than solar and (3)\textasciitilde{}particularly large number of member stars. We discovered two new very blue stars increasing the total of sdB objects in the cluster to ten. They are located in a very narrow range magnitudes \$V=17.7 \textbackslash{}pm 0.5\$; their blue colors strongly constrain our determination of the reddening of the cluster to \$E(B-V)=0.17 \textbackslash{}pm 0.01\$. We detected no other blue stars except a population of faint objects with \$V \textbackslash{}approx 22\$ in the center of the cluster. We have used the new theoretical isochrones in a differential determination of metallicity and age of NGC\textasciitilde{}6791 using M67 and NGC\textasciitilde{}188 as two clusters with well-known abundaces and age. We find \$[Fe/H] \textbackslash{}simeq +0.5\$ and age by 1\textasciitilde{}Gyr older than that of NGC\textasciitilde{}188. The luminosity function of the cluster is surpisingly flat while the ``secondary'' main-sequence of equal-mass binaries is weaker than in less-populous old open clusters. We explain both features by the large total mass of the cluster which has lead to weak evaporation of low-mass and single stars from the cluster.},

  title = {{{OPTICAL SPECTROSCOPY OF THE RED HORIZONTAL BRANCH STARS OF NGC}} 679},
  abstract = {We have obtained 3600-4600 {\^A} spectra at \textasciitilde{}5 {\^A} resolution for 31 stars in the field of NGC 6791, one of the oldest and most ``globular-cluster-like'' of the Galactic open clusters. Based on spectroscopic analysis of 19 of these stars considered to be red horizontal branch (RHB) members of NGC 6791, we conclude that there is no evidence for significant variations in the CH band or the Ca and Fe line strengths among these stars, although there are strong indications of intrinsic differences among the CN band strengths. There is also no evidence for correlations between the CN band, CH band, or Fe line strengths of these stars, although there may be a weak correlation between CN band and Ca line strengths. The nature of the CN-band inhomogeneity is in marked contrast to the bimodal CN distributions discovered among the RHB stars of the two globular clusters 47 Tue and M71 by Norris \& Freeman [ApJ, 254, 143 (1982)] and Smith \& Penny [AJ, 97, 1397 (1989)]. These results imply that either the environment within which globular clusters formed resulted in initial C and N abundance inhomogeneities that were lacking in NGC 6791, or that the evolutional processes which alter stellar surface abundances prior to or during the core helium-burning phase of evolution, differ in some respect between the disk globular clusters and NGC 6791. \textcopyright{} 1995 American Astronomical Society.},

  abstract = {A selected sample of 1400 AO/1 to F2/(log Te=3.96 to 3.82) stars with accurate photometric and astrometric data are discussed on the basis of luminosities obtained from both Str{\"o}mgren+H/? and Geneva photometry. The sample contains members of the Hyades, Sirius, and HR 1614 superclusters, all of which show an appreciable age spread. The spread of 6 to 20X108 yr in the Hyades supercluster is reflected in a spread of about 6 to 10X108 yr in the Praesepe and Hyades clusters within the supercluster. Strong arguments are presented for the presence of a larger age spread in the noncluster supercluster members than in the contained clusters. The age range for members of the Sirius supercluster is 2 to 6X108 yr and nearly all of this range is seen in the UMa nucleus of the Sirius supercluster, contained within the supercluster. The HR 1614 supercluster is near 4X109 yr old and may include the old disk cluster NGC 6791. About three-quarters of bright A-star sample consists of young disk stars, on the basis of their (U, V) velocities. The Am, USPC (Set), and X Boo stars represent about 10\%, 6\%, and 1\%, respectively, of the total sample as well as of the young disk and old disk constituents of the sample. Although at least 7 USPC ({$<$}5Sct) are also Am stars, the two types, generally, are separated by about 2X108 yr. The rotational velocities, at various temperatures intervals, of the Am stars are about one-half those of the USPC({$<$}5Sct) in the same intervals, whereas these velocities for the USPC and normal stars are nearly identical. At least 50\% of the Am stars are spectroscopic binaries, half of which are double lined, whereas only 20\% of the USPC are known spectroscopic binaries. The 15 X Boo stars discussed here contain 8 young disk and 4 old disk stars, with 3 objects of unknown population because of radial velocity variations. Six young disk X Boo stars are members of the Hyades (3) or Sirius (3) supercluster. The age of the X Boo stars appears to be between 6 and 10X108 yr. The so-called ``A2 IV'' stars, labeled as possible peculiar objects by Abt (1994), may define the blue edge of the instability region. The USPC in the sample place the blue edge near log =3.904 for My {$>$}+0.75 mag. Four stars classified as USPC are considerably hotter than the blue edge and are probably a different type of object. The old disk (BS) stars constitute about one-quarter of the bright A-star sample in each of the stages\textemdash{}normal stars, Am stars, USPC, and X Boo stars. The spectroscopic binary frequency ranges from at least 50\% for the Am stars to less than 5\% for normal stars. This situation is the strongest argument for new birth as the origin of BS or, if rebirth, that whatever the required conditions they must mimic those for new birth. The strongest argument for rebirth as the origin of BS may be in the Am stars. Despite the fact that Am and USPC appear to be successive stages of evolution, separated by the blue edge of the instability region, and that at least a half-dozen USPC are also Am stars, the large difference in the apparent rotational velocity and large difference in the spectroscopic binary frequency makes such successive evolutionary stages seem unlikely. However, this very difficulty suggests the possibility that forward evolution for Am stars ends near the blue edge and coalescence or merger of the components ensues. \textcopyright{} 1995 American Astronomical Society.},

If these hot stars are in their core helium-burning phase, they are significantly bluer (hotter) than predicted by canonical stellar evolution theory. No obvious explanation is available yet. We consider the effects of mass loss during the evolution of horizontal-branch (HB) stars as their possible origin. We find that the addition of mass loss causes HB stars to evolve to be hotter and fainter. Mass loss has a more pronounced effect for less massive stars and thus naturally widens the temperature (and color) distribution on the HB. If mass-loss rates are higher for more metal-rich stars, this phenomenon would be even more pronounced in the metal-rich populations, such as NGC 6791. We find that mass loss on the HB may be a viable method of forming subdwarf B (sdB) stars both in the field and in clusters, especially when the metallicity is high.},

  abstract = {The color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) of five old open clusters, namely NGC 2682, NGC 2243, Berkeley 39, NGC 188, and NGC 6791 are examined in detail with the aid of the synthetic color-magnitude diagram technique described by Carraro et al. (1993), and the color excess E\_B-V\_, distance modulus (m-M), and age of each cluster are derived. The goal is to provide an homogeneous ranking of the cluster ages. The analysis is made using two types of stellar models in which different prescriptions are adopted for the extension of the convective cores, i.e. either the classical or the overshoot scheme. The stellar models in use are from Alongi et al. (1993), Bressan et al. (1993), and Fagotto et al.
(1993a,b). The evolutionary tracks go from the main sequence up to the start of the thermally pulsing regime of the asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. The purpose is to discriminate between the two
evolutionary scenarios. It turns out that all the clusters have turn-off masses either slightly greater or equal to the value of 1.1
Msun\_, at which we expect the transition from convective to radiative core H-burning to occur. As far as the mixing mechanism is concerned, the results are not very conclusive. For the youngest clusters of our sample, namely NGC 2682 and NGC 2243, models with convective overshoot seem to provide a slightly better fit of the observed CMD and luminosity function. For the oldest cluster of our sample, namely NGC 6791 with age of 8 Gyr, there is no appreciable difference passing from one scheme to another. Finally, for the
remaining clusters, namely Berkeley 39 and NGC 188, the situation is ambiguous. This trend is not surprising, because we expect the
convective core and hence associated overshoot to vanish at decreasing turn-off mass and hence increasing age. As expected the ages derived from overshoot models are slightly older than those obtained from standard models. The five clusters on consideration can be ranked as function of the age as follows (the first value refers to classical models, the second one to models with overshoot): NGC 2682 (4.3 Gyr and 4.8 Gyr), NGC 2243 (3.5 Gyr and 3.9 Gyr), Berkeley 39, (6.0 Gyr and 6.5 Gyr), and NGC 188 (7.0 Gyr and 7.5 Gyr).

Although the RGB phase transition may be safely settled between 2 and 2.5 solar masses, the mass limit discriminating between clusters dominated by clump stars and those dominated by subgiant stars is of the order of 1.8 solar masses. In the range of ages between 0.6 and 10 Gyr, the
luminosity of the central He-burning models is found to be almost insensitive to the age, supporting the use of clump stars to derive the cluster distance moduli.},

The cluster kinematics suggest strongly that they are drawn from the old thin disk stellar population. An abundance gradient in the Galactic disk of -0.09 +/- 0.02 dex/kpc is found. This gradient is in good agreement with that found for samples of younger open clusters, suggesting that there has been little change in the Galactic radial abundance gradient over time.

  abstract = {V and I photometry out to 12 min from the center of the old, populous, metal-rich, open cluster NGC 6791 has revealed 16 bright stars (I less than or equal to 12.5) with 1.6 less than or equal to V - I less than or equal to 4.1. Follow-up spectroscopy indicates that (1) at least 12 of these red-giant branch (RGB) candidates are bona fide cluster members, and (2) their metallicity, as estimated from the strength of the Ca II infrared triplet lines, is slightly above solar. If the core
helium-burning (`clump') stars in NGC 6791 have a mean MV = 0.9, which is the current best estimate for that of their counterparts in the (M/H) approximately equal to 0.0 cluster M67, then the apparent distance modulus of the former is near (m - M)V approximately equal to 13.6. This would imply an age of about 9 Gyr, from appropriate stellar models, versus approximately equal to 4.5 Gyr for M67.
Importantly, with this estimate of the distance -- which is unlikely to be in error by more than +/- 0.25 mag -- the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of NGC 6791 intimates that its RGB does not rise above
MI approximately -2.7. In contrast, the RGBs of all Galactic globular clusters with metallicities of one-quarter solar or less are presently believed to reach MI approximately equal to -4.0, though fainter tip magnitudes have been inferred for the very few globulars of higher metal abundance (e.g., NGC 6553) that have been studied. If the tip MI value does not vary with metallicity among (at least) the most metal-rich systems, then that variation can be expected to affect, e.g., estimates of the extragalactic distance scale based on the `surface brightness fluctuation' method. Consequently, NGC 6791 provides an exceedingly important constraint on our understanding of old, metal-rich stellar populations. Encouragingly, theoretical evolutionary tracks whose temperatures and colors are consistent with various empirical constraints appear to provide a fine match to the upper CMD of NGC 6791, if the cluster metallicity is (M/H) greater than 0.0.},

Five sites with 1 m class telescopes participated in an intensive monitoring effort, yielding contiguous 14 night coverage with 1 min temporal resolution. Noise levels to 0.0008 mag variation relative to an ensemble mean were attained at 13th mag over 9 hr time series. Limits to detection of coherent oscillations with periods of 3-20 min, assuming a solarlike spectrum of frequencies, are 100 micromag (30 times solar amplitude) for the best cases. Evidence suggestive of p-mode oscillations is shown for a few stars, but an unambiguous detection is not claimed. Serendipitous detection was made of two new W UMa stars in M67, two oscillating blue stragglers (with multiple modes) a likely AM Her cataclysmic variable with a 2.091 hr period, and several stars with low-amplitude intensity changes over timescales of 1-10 days, that presumably result from rotation or orbital motion.},

Under two assumptions: spherical symmetry of the cluster and isotropy of the velocity distribution at every point, general expressions are derived (Eqs. 15 and 23). These expressions are in the case of Plummer's model (Eqs. 31, 36, 41, 43). Reasonable agreement is found with the resnlts derived from numerical experiments by Aarseth and Wielen.

The radial extent of NGC 6791 is at least 9.3 arcmin, and its central radius is r(c) about 124 arcsec. The contribution of the field stars to the different parts of the cluster color magnitude diagrams (V vs. B-V and V vs. V-I) is studied. NGC 6791 possesses about 47 blue stragglers and about 55 yellow stragglers. It harbors about 174 red giants, 22 of them horizontal branch stars. Seven candidates for sdB/sdO subdwarfs were discovered in the cluster field. Under assumption of cluster membership they possess M(v) between 3.6 and 4.8 and (B-V)0 between -0.35 and -0.14. The color index of the bluest sdB/sdO candidate provides an upper limit on the cluster reddening E(B-V = 0) not greater than 0.195. The observed luminosity function of NGC 6791 is more or less constant for V between 17.5 and 21.0 and then brakes due to increasing incompleteness of the photometry.

  abstract = {Optical spectrophotometry of seven faint, extremely blue stars found by Kaluzny \& Udalski (1992) in the open cluster NGC 6791 is presented and analyzed using model atmosphere fits to the Balmer and He I line profiles. Four are subdwarf B (sdB) stars with 24000 K less than or approximately Teff less than or approximately 32 000 K and +4.3 less than or approximately Mv less than or approximately +4.5, at least three of which are likely to be extended horizontal branch (EHB) members of this old, metal-rich cluster. One is a subdwarf O star, Mv = +4.0, and could be a post-horizontal branch or AGB-manque star in the cluster. One cataclysmic variable is found, also a possible member. The brightest and coolest candidate is most likely a nonmember B star of lower gravity. As a by-product of the analysis, the mean reddening of the cluster is estimated to be E(B-V) = 0.14. These results imply that the core helium-burning, horizontal branch (HB) of NGC 6791 has an extremely bimodal distribution of hydrogen envelope mass. Most stars with total masses approximately 0.7 solar mass form a normal red 'clump' in the color-magnitude diagram, while greater than or approximately 15\% lie in a tight group on the EHB with very little (less than 0.01 solar mass) hydrogen envelope overlying the approximately 0.5 solar mass core. It is difficult to see how such a large fraction of EHB stars with almost identically small envelope masses could have been produced by single star mass loss rates with any reasonable dispersion. It seems equally difficult to understand how a binary mass transfer mechanism could be so fine-tuned. Though we cannot satisfactorily explain the unusual HB morphology in NGC 6791, the EHB stars in this younger, metal-rich disk cluster must have formed in a much lower density environment under a very different set of circumstances than their globular cluster counterparts. We further suggest that the similar sdB/EHB stars of the field are produced mainly by the most metal-rich component of the disk population. In support of this hypothesis, there seem to be few, if any, EHB stars in old open clusters of solar
metallicity or less. The implied far-ultraviolet (less than 2000 A) radiation appropriate for the hot, evolved population of NGC 6791 will yield an integrated cluster LUV/ Lbol comparable to those observed in the metal-rich elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges. Since the stellar sources in the latter may come from a
population similar to NGC 6791 in metallicity, age, and stellar density, we suggest that a like fraction of evolved, hot stars exists in the unresolved extragalactic populations. Current data are consistent with the working hypothesis that the trend of increasing far-UV radiation with increasing metallicity found for elliptical galaxies may also apply to the galactic disk.},

Broadband UBVI CCD images were taken with a 512x512 CCD and included deep frames on the center, plus a 3x3 mosaic of the cluster. With this reddening the UBV 2-color diagram for the cluster does not match the standard solar-metallicity 2-color diagram. The substantial Ultra Violet (UV) deficiency requires the cluster to be metal rich. Regardless of the choice of reddening value, if we make the assumption of solar metallicity for the cluster we cannot simultaneously derive a consistent fit of the 2-color diagram to standard 2-color sequences and the color-magnitude diagram to published isochrones. A comparison with solar-metallicity isochrones provides only an upper limit of approximately 10 Gyrs for the age for the cluster.},

challenges when characterizing exoplanet systems, particularly when
studying small (sub-Neptune-sized) planets orbiting solar-type stars. In
this letter we predicted for dwarfs and giants the jitter due to stellar
oscillations, which in velocity have much larger amplitudes than noise
introduced by granulation. We then fitted the jitter in terms of the
following sets of stellar parameters: (1) Luminosity, mass, and
effective temperature: the fit returns precisions (i.e. standard
deviations of fractional residuals) of 17.9 and 27.1 per cent for dwarfs
and giants, respectively. (2) Luminosity, effective temperature, and
surface gravity: the precisions are the same as using the previous
parameter set. (3) Surface gravity and effective temperature: we obtain
a precision of 22.6 per cent for dwarfs and 27.1 per cent for giants.
(4) Luminosity and effective temperature: the precision is 47.8 per cent
for dwarfs and 27.5 per cent for giants. Our method will be valuable for
anticipating the radial-velocity stellar noise level of exoplanet host
stars to be found by the TESS and PLATO space missions, and thus can be
useful for their follow-up spectroscopic observations. We provide
publicly available code (https://github.com/Jieyu126/Jitter) to set a
prior for the jitter term as a component when modelling the Keplerian
orbits of the exoplanets.},

previously been shown to be capable of efficiently classifying the
evolutionary state of oscillating red giants into red giant branch stars
and helium-core burning stars by recognizing visual features in their
asteroseismic frequency spectra. We elaborate further on the deep
learning method by developing an improved convolutional neural network
classifier. To make our method useful for current and future space
missions such as K2, TESS, and PLATO, we train classifiers that are able
to classify the evolutionary states of lower frequency resolution
spectra expected from these missions. Additionally, we provide new
classifications for 8633 Kepler red giants, out of which 426 have
previously not been classified using asteroseismology. This brings the
total to 14983 Kepler red giants classified with our new neural network.
We also verify that our classifiers are remarkably robust to suboptimal
data, including low signal-to-noise and incorrect training truth labels.},

fundamental cluster parameters such as cluster centre coordinates, mean
proper motions, radial velocity, distance, reddening, age and tidal

the near-infrared (NIR) and optical cluster distance scales. We find
that distances and reddening values obtained from the colour-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs) in the NIR agree well with earlier distance estimates
based on optical CMDs. These newly obtained homogeneous distances,
together with the other cluster parameters, allow us to study the
properties of the open cluster population in the Galactic disk.},

  abstract = {Context. Although they are the main constituents of the Galactic disk 
population, for half of the open clusters in the Milky Way reported in
the literature nothing is known except the raw position and an
approximate size. Aims: The main goal of this study is to
determine a full set of uniform spatial, structural, kinematic, and
astrophysical parameters for as many known open clusters as possible.
 Methods: On the basis of stellar data from PPMXL and 2MASS, we
used a dedicated data-processing pipeline to determine kinematic and
photometric membership probabilities for stars in a cluster region. Results: For an input list of 3784 targets from the literature, we
confirm that 3006 are real objects, the vast majority of them are open
clusters, but associations and globular clusters are also present. For
each confirmed object we determined the exact position of the cluster
centre, the apparent size, proper motion, distance, colour excess, and
age. For about 1500 clusters, these basic astrophysical parameters have
been determined for the first time. For the bulk of the clusters we also
derived the tidal radius. We estimated additionally average radial
velocities for more than 30\% of the confirmed clusters. The present
sample (called MWSC) reaches both the central parts of the Milky Way and
its outer regions. It is almost complete up to 1.8 kpc from the Sun and
also covers neighbouring spiral arms. However, for a small subset of the
oldest open clusters (log t {$\greaterequivlnt$} 9) we found some evidence of
incompleteness within about 1 kpc from the Sun.

  abstract = {An all-sky target list of 3784 entries with initial cluster parameters 
was compiled from sources available in the literature. As the primary
source we used the data from the Catalogue of Open Cluster Data (COCD,
Kharchenko et al. 2005a,b, Cat. J/A+A/438/1163, J/A+A/440/403). For
further optical clusters the data were taken from the Dias et al. (2002,
Cat. B/ocl) list (Version 3.1, 24/nov/2010). Known associations were
retrieved from Melnik \& Dambis (2009, Cat. J/MNRAS/400/518). For
clusters detected in the NIR the information came from Bica et al.
(2003b, Cat. J/A+A/404/223), Dutra et al. (2003, Cat. J/A+A/400/533),
Froebrich et al. (2007, Cat. J/MNRAS/374/399). Globular clusters were
selected from the catalogue by Harris (1996, edition 2010,
2010arXiv1012.3224H). Additionally, we incorporated supplementary data
on embedded clusters from Bica et al. (2003a, Cat. J/A+A/397/177), Lada
\& Lada (2003ARA\&A..41...57L) and on stars in associations from
Humphreys (1978, Cat. V/44).

The basic stellar data were taken from the all-sky catalogue 2MAst
(2Mass with Astrometry), that was extracted from the all-sky catalogues
PPMXL (Roeser et al. 2010, Cat. I/317) and 2MASS (Cutri et al. 2003,
Cat. II/246). Additionally, we incorporated data on radial velocities
from Kharchenko et al. (2007, Cat. III/254) and spectral types from
ASCC-2.5 (Kharchenko \& Roeser 2009, Cat. I/280).

Around each object from our target list we defined a circular area with
a radius of ra=r2+radd where r2 is the cluster radius, and
radd=0.3\textdegree. In these areas we selected in 2MAst only those stars with
flags Rflg (the 2nd triple of the flags in 2MASS) set to 1, 2, or 3 in
each band, i.e. the stars with the best quality detections in
photometric and astrometric data.

There are 3784 targets in our object list, we confirmed 3006 clusters
and/or associations. These 3006 sky areas contain about 63.5 mln 2MAst
stars with best quality detections in photometric and astrometric data.
We selected about 0.14 mln most probable members located in the central
cluster regions and determined - with a homogeneous method/pipeline -
angular sizes of the main morphological parts, heliocentric distances,
colour-excesses, mean proper motions, ages, tidal parameters, sometimes
radial velocities and metallicities.

We present for the Milky Way:

The Catalogue of the MWSC Data with: Catalogue of parameters for
confirmed clusters; Index (full list) of MWSC objects; Notes (full
object list with notes); Inside each list the entries are sorted by MWSC
numbers (i.e. right ascension J2000 from the target list).

The Catalogues of the MWSC Stars in 3006 circular sky areas with
classified clusters. Files are sorted by MWSC numbers; inside each sky
area the entries are sorted by Ks magnitudes.

The Atlas of MWSC diagrams. In the Atlas, the Cluster pages are sorted
by MWSC numbers.

  abstract = {Aims: In this study we determine absolute integrated magnitudes 
in the J,H,KS passbands for Galactic star clusters from the
Milky Way Star Clusters survey. In the wide solar neighbourhood, we
derive the open cluster luminosity function (CLF) for different cluster
ages. Methods: The integrated magnitudes are based on uniform
cluster membership derived from the 2MAst catalogue (a merger of the
PPMXL and 2MASS) and are computed by summing up the individual
luminosities of the most reliable cluster members. We discuss two
different techniques of constructing the CLF, a magnitude-limited and a
distance-limited approach. Results: Absolute J,H,KS
integrated magnitudes are obtained for 3061 open clusters, and 147
globular clusters. The integrated magnitudes and colours are accurate to
about 0.8 and 0.2 mag, respectively. Based on the sample of open
clusters we construct the general cluster luminosity function in the
solar neighbourhood in the three passbands. In each passband the CLF
shows a linear part covering a range of 6 to 7 mag at the bright end.
The CLFs reach their maxima at an absolute magnitude of -2 mag, then
drop by one order of magnitude. During cluster evolution, the CLF
changes its slope within tight, but well-defined limits. The CLF of the
youngest clusters has a steep slope of about 0.4 at bright magnitudes
and a quasi-flat portion for faint clusters. For the oldest population,
we find a flatter function with a slope of about 0.2. The CLFs at
Galactocentric radii smaller than that of the solar circle differ from
those in the direction of the Galactic anti-centre. The CLF in the inner
area is flatter and the cluster surface density higher than the local
one. In contrast, the CLF is somewhat steeper than the local one in the
outer disk, and the surface density is lower.

photometric system of Landolt and then discuss methods for selecting a subset of cluster stars whose photometric indices are most likely to be of high reliability. Color-magnitude and color-color diagrams for the cluster are presented and discussed. A detailed comparison of this photometry with the results of previous observational studies is presented. We make preliminary comparisons with theoretical isochrones provided by D. A. VandenBerg and conclude that an excellent match can be achieved if the metal abundance and age of the cluster are both near the upper end of the range of recent estimates ([Fe/H]\textasciitilde{}+0.3, age\textasciitilde{}12 Gyr) and the reddening and true distance modulus are both near the low end of the range of recent estimates [E(B-V)\textasciitilde{}0.09 mag and (m-M)0\textasciitilde{}12.79 mag] if the isochrone predictions are reliable. A companion paper will discuss candidate variable stars and stars possibly showing planetary transits.

  abstract = {This paper presents a combined method of Gaussian mixture model and random forest to compute membership probabilities of stars by using large, high-dimensional data sets. A significant advantage of this method is that it allows us to easily identify likely cluster members in large data sets starting from small training samples. As a benchmark, we select 40318 stars in the field of the open cluster NGC 6405 from the Gaia Data Release 2 ( Gaia -DR2) by means of all five astrometric (positions, proper motions, and parallax) and photometric parameters. We use this combined method to determine likely cluster members in an eleven-dimensional parameter space. A total number of 518 high-probability ({$\geq$}0.6) memberships are obtained, and the mean parallax and proper motion of the cluster are determined to be 2.171 {$\pm$} 0.005 mas (461 {$\pm$} 1 pc) and ( \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/1538-3881/156/3/121/ajaad690ieqn1.gif] \$\textbackslash{}langle \textbackslash{}mu \_\textbackslash{}alpha \textbackslash{}cos \textbackslash{}delta \textbackslash{}rangle ,\textbackslash{}langle \textbackslash{}mu \_\textbackslash{}delta \textbackslash{}rangle \$ ) = (-1.357 {$\pm$} 0.023,-5.823 {$\pm$} 0.020) mas yr -1 , respectively. In addition, we quantitatively evaluate the relative importance of the parameters for membership determination and find that colors and magnitudes cannot be ignored in membership determination when using the RF method. Our results show that this combined method exhibits good performance in handling arbitrary high-dimensional and large data sets, such as Gaia -DR2, and it can also be used to investigate other open clusters.},

  issn = {0035-8711, 1365-2966},
  abstract = {We propose a method for calculating the radius of an open cluster in an objective way from an astrometric catalogue containing, at least, positions and proper motions. It uses the minimum spanning tree (hereinafter MST) in the proper motion space to discriminate cluster stars from field stars and it quantifies the strength of the cluster-field separation by means of a statistical parameter defined for the first time in this paper. This is done for a range of different sampling radii from where the cluster radius is obtained as the size at which the best cluster-field separation is achieved. The novelty of this strategy is that the cluster radius is obtained independently of how its stars are spatially distributed. We test the reliability and robustness of the method with both simulated and real data from a well-studied open cluster (NGC 188), and apply it to UCAC4 data for five other open clusters with different catalogued radius values. NGC 188, NGC 1647, NGC 6603 and Ruprecht 155 yielded unambiguous radius values of 15.2+/-1.8, 29.4+/-3.4, 4.2+/-1.7 and 7.0+/-0.3 arcmin, respectively. ASCC 19 and Collinder 471 showed more than one possible solution but it is not possible to know whether this is due to the involved uncertainties or to the presence of complex patterns in their proper motion distributions, something that could be inherent to the physical object or due to the way in which the catalogue was sampled.},

  abstract = {Methods. We use methods of stellar statistics and develop a semi-empirical model of open clusters.
Results. We check two effects impacting the determination of tidal radii from a fitting of King's profiles to the observed density distribution, i.e., ellipticity of open clusters and a bias depending on distances. Though a typical cluster has an elliptical form, the effect is rather weak to produce a prominent bias in the resulting tidal radii. In contrast, a distance dependent bias is not negligible and can cause a systematic underestimation of tidal radii computed with ASCC-2.5 data by a factor of two for the most distant clusters of our sample. This finding is used to correct the original results for 236 clusters and to extend the system of tidal radii and masses to all 650 clusters. We found that the semi-major axis of the projected distribution of cluster members on the sky is a parameter suited to estimate tidal radii of open clusters of our sample. No systematic differences are found between measured and calibrated tidal radii. From the comparison with mass estimates based on star counts and on the assumption of the Salpeter IMF, empirical evidence is obtained for an evolution of cluster mass functions starting in young clusters.
Conclusions. The set of homogeneous parameters available for all clusters of our sample is extended by tidal radius and mass. Within 850 pc where our sample is complete, the distributions of tidal radii and masses peak at rt {$\approx$} 6 pc and log Mc/m {$\approx$} 2.5, respectively. In young open clusters, the mass distributions show differences to the Salpeter IMF, and this discrepancy increases with cluster age.},

We also examine statistically the distribution of stars of different masses within clusters as a function of the cluster age.\emph{Results.\emph{No significant dependence of the cluster size on location in the Galaxy is detected for younger clusters ({$<$}200 Myr), whereas older clusters inside the solar orbit turned out to be, on average, smaller than outside. Also, small old clusters are preferentially found close to the Galactic plane, whereas larger ones more frequently live farther away from the plane and at larger Galactocentric distances. For clusters with , a clear dependence of the apparent radius on age has been detected: the cluster radii decrease by a factor of about 2 from an age of 10 Myr to an age of 1 Gyr. A detailed analysis shows that this observed effect can be explained by mass segregation and does not necessarily reflect a real decrease of cluster radii. We found evidence for the latter for the majority of clusters older than 30 Myr. Among the youngest clusters (between 5 and 30 Myr), there are some clusters with a significant grade of mass segregation, whereas some others show no segregation at all. At a cluster age between 50 and 100 Myr, the distribution of stars of different masses becomes more regular over cluster area. In older clusters the evolution of the massive stars is the most prominent effect we observe.}}}}}}},

We obtained UBVRI photometry of the cluster on six nights (four of them photometric) with the 1.08 m Hall and 1.83 m Perkins telescopes at Lowell Observatory. The mean photometric precision ranges from better than 0.01 mag in the V , B \textendash{} V , V \textendash{} R , and V \textendash{} I indices among stars brighter than magnitude 15 to about 0.05 mag for U \textendash{} B at magnitude 18. We followed a Bayesian statistical approach using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to determine the cluster reddening, distance, age, and iron content from a maximum-likelihood fit to stellar isochrones.

A CCD survey of the cluster on the uvbyCa H{$\beta$} system, coupled with proper-motion membership, has been used to isolate 382 highly probable, single-star unevolved main-sequence members over a 20' field centered on the cluster. From 278 F dwarfs with high precision photometry in all indices, a mean reddening of E ( b \textendash{} y ) = 0.117 {$\pm$} 0.005 or E ( B \textendash{} V ) = 0.160 {$\pm$} 0.007 is derived, where the standard errors of the mean include both internal errors and the photometric zero-point uncertainty.

If metallicity is derived using individual reddening values for each star to account for potential reddening variation across the face of the cluster, the analogous result is unchanged. The cluster members at the turnoff of the color-magnitude diagram are used to test and confirm the recently discovered variation in reddening across the face of the cluster, with a probable range in the variation of {$\Delta$} E ( B \textendash{} V ) = 0.045 {$\pm$} 0.015. With the slightly higher reddening and lower [Fe/H] compared to commonly adopted values, isochrone fitting leads to an age of 2.3 {$\pm$} 0.2 Gyr for an apparent modulus of ( m \textendash{} M ) = 12.40 {$\pm$} 0.12.},

The fitting approach uses an objective {$\chi$} 2 minimization technique to derive the cluster properties and their uncertainties. We found the ages, distances, and reddenings for 24 of the clusters, and the distances and reddenings for 6 additional clusters that were either sparse or faint in the near-IR.

To test the accuracy of the fitting technique, synthetic clusters with 50, 100, or 200 cluster members and a wide range of ages were fit. These tests recovered the input parameters within their uncertainties for more than 90\% of the individual synthetic cluster parameters.

  abstract = {We present analysis of deep CCD photometry for the very rich, old open star cluster NGC 6819. The science goals are to catalog the white dwarfs in the cluster and measure the cluster luminosity and mass functions. These CFH12K data results represent the first of nineteen open star clusters which were imaged as a part of the CFHT Open Star Cluster Survey. We find a tight, very rich, main-sequence and turnoff consisting of over 2900 cluster stars in the V , B - V color-magnitude diagram (CMD). Main-sequence fitting of the unevolved cluster stars with the Hyades star cluster yields a distance modulus of ( m - M ) V = 12.30 {$\pm$} 0.12, for a reddening of E ( B - V ) = 0.10. These values are consistent with a newly calculated theoretical stellar isochrone of age 2.5 Gyr, which we take to be the age of the cluster. Both the depth gained in the photometry and the increased projected area of the CFH12K Mosaic CCD allow for detailed star counts in concentric annuli out to large angular radii. These indicate a much larger cluster extent ( R = 9 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcm.gif] farcm 5 {$\pm$} 1 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcm.gif] farcm 0), by a factor of 2 over some previous estimates. Incompleteness tests confirm a slightly negatively sloped luminosity function extending to faint ( V 23) magnitudes which is indicative of a dynamically evolved cluster. Further luminosity function and mass segregation tests indicate that low-mass objects ( M {$\leq$} 0.65 M {$\odot$} ) predominate in the outer regions of the cluster, 3 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcm.gif] farcm 5 {$\leq$} R {$\leq$} 9 \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/farcm.gif] farcm 5. The estimation of the number of white dwarfs in NGC 6819, based on stellar evolution models, white dwarf cooling timescales, and conservation of star number arguments applied to the red giant stars of the cluster are in good agreement with the observed number. For those white dwarf candidates which pass both a statistical subtraction that removes background galaxies and field stars and a high star/galaxy confidence by using image classification, we show comparisons with white dwarf isochrones and cooling models which suggest the need for spectroscopy to confirm the white dwarf nature of the brighter objects. This is entirely feasible for all objects, before a statistical subtraction cut, with the current generation of 8 m\textendash{}class telescopes and multiobject spectrometers.},

We identify 31 {$\delta$} Scuti and 8 {$\gamma$} Doradus pulsating variables as well as 23 red giants with solar-like oscillations. There are 4 eclipsing binaries and 106 stars showing rotational modulation indicative of starspots. We
attempted to identify cluster members using their proper motions but found very poor discrimination between members and non-members. The KIC shows a concentration of stars with distance modulus
V0-MV=10.47+/-0.02. We used assumed radial modes in 9 {$\delta$} Sct stars to determine their asteroseismic luminosities and found that the distance modulus falls within three narrow ranges depending on the assignment of overtone number. One of these ranges coincides with the KIC distance modulus. The rotation periods of main-sequence stars are correlated with colour, so that a
period-age-mass relation can be derived from open clusters and applied to stars of unknown ages. Surprisingly, we find that the correlation applies not only to cool stars, but extends to A-type stars in the cluster. Finally, we present measurements of solar-like oscillations in red giants, a few of which might be cluster members.

A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESAstar solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate
independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the
extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete
evolutionary track of a 1 M sun star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.

  abstract = {Context. Currently galactic exploration is being revolutionized by a flow of new data: Gaia provides measurements of stellar distances and kinematics; growing numbers of spectroscopic surveys provide values of stellar atmospheric parameters and abundances of elements; and Kepler and K2 missions provide asteroseismic information for an increasing number of stars. Aims. In this work we aim to determine stellar distances and ages using Gaia and spectrophotometric data in a consistent way. We estimate precisions of age and distance determinations with Gaia end-of-mission and TGAS parallax precisions. Methods. To this end we incorporated parallax and extinction data into the isochrone fitting method used in the Unified tool to estimate Distances, Ages, and Masses (UniDAM). We prepared datasets that allowed us to study the improvement of distance and age estimates with the inclusion of TGAS and Gaia end-of-mission parallax precisions in isochrone fitting. Results. Using TGAS parallaxes in isochrone fitting we are able to reduce distance and age estimate uncertainties for TGAS stars for distances up to 1 kpc by more than one third, compared to results based only on spectrophotometric data. With Gaia end-of-mission parallaxes in isochrone fitting we will be able to further decrease our distance uncertainties by about a factor of 20 and age uncertainties by a factor of two for stars up to 10 kpc away from the Sun. Conclusions. We demonstrate that we will be able to improve our distance estimates for about one third of stars in spectroscopic surveys and to decrease log(age) uncertainties by about a factor of two for over 80\% of stars as compared to the uncertainties obtained without parallax priors using Gaia end-of-mission parallaxes consistently with spectrophotometry in isochrone fitting .},

  abstract = {Stellar evolution theory has been extraordinarily successful at explaining the different phases under which stars form, evolve and die. While the strongest constraints have traditionally come from binary stars, the advent of asteroseismology is bringing unique measures in well-characterised stars. For stellar populations in general, however, only photometric measures are usually available, and the comparison with the predictions of stellar evolution theory have mostly been qualitative. For instance, the geometrical shapes of isochrones have been used to infer ages of coeval populations, but without any proper statistical basis. In this chapter we provide a pedagogical review on a Bayesian formalism to make quantitative inferences on the properties of single, binary and small ensembles of stars, including unresolved populations. As an example, we show how stellar evolution theory can be used in a rigorous way as a prior information to measure the ages of stars between the ZAMS and the Helium flash, and their uncertainties, using photometric data only.},

  abstract = {We present a new technique to fit color\textendash{}magnitude diagrams of open clusters based on the cross-entropy global optimization algorithm. The method uses theoretical isochrones available in the literature and maximizes a weighted likelihood function based on distances measured in the color\textendash{}magnitude space. The weights are obtained through a non parametric technique that takes into account the star distance to the observed center of the cluster, observed magnitude uncertainties, the stellar density profile of the cluster among others. The parameters determined simultaneously are distance, reddening, age and metallicity. The method takes binary fraction into account and uses a Monte-Carlo approach to obtain uncertainties on the determined parameters for the cluster by running the fitting algorithm many times with a re-sampled data set through a bootstrapping procedure. We present results for 9 well studied open clusters, based on 15 distinct data sets, and show that the results are consistent with previous studies. The method is shown to be reliable and free of the subjectivity of most previous visual isochrone fitting techniques.},

  abstract = {We present a catalogue of distances, masses and ages for \$\textbackslash{}sim3\$ million stars in the second Gaia data release with spectroscopic parameters available from the large spectroscopic surveys: APOGEE, Gaia-ESO, GALAH, LAMOST, RAVE and SEGUE. We use a Bayesian framework to characterise the probability density functions of distance, mass and age using photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric information, supplemented with spectroscopic masses where available for giant stars. Furthermore, we provide posterior extinction estimates (\$A\_V\$) to every star using published extinction maps as a prior input. We provide an appendix with extinction coefficients for Gaia photometry derived from stellar models, which account for variation with intrinsic colour and total extinction. Our pipeline provides output estimates of the spectroscopic parameters, which can be used to inform improved spectroscopic analysis. We complement our catalogues with Galactocentric coordinates and actions with associated uncertainties. As a demonstration of the power of our catalogue, we produce velocity dispersion profiles of the disc separated by age and Galactocentric radius (between \$3\$ and \$15\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}mathrm\{kpc\}\$ from the Galactic centre). This suggests that the velocity dispersion profiles flatten with radius in the outer Galaxy (\${$>$}8\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}mathrm\{kpc\}\$) and that at all radii the velocity dispersion follows the smooth power law with age observed in the solar neighbourhood.},

  title = {Asteroseismic Age Estimates of {{RGB}} Stars in Open Clusters. {{A}} Statistical Investigation of Different Estimation Methods},
  abstract = {We performed a theoretical investigation focused on the age estimate of RGB stars in OCs based on mixed classical surface and asteroseismic parameters. We evaluated the performances of three widely adopted methods (pure geometrical fit, maximum likelihood approach, and a single stars fit) in recovering stellar parameters. Artificial OCs were generated by means of a Monte Carlo procedure for two different ages (7.5 and 9.0 Gyr) and two different choices of the number of stars in the RGB evolutionary phase (35 and 80). The geometrical approach overestimated the age by about 0.3 and 0.2 Gyr for true ages of 7.5 and 9.0 Gyr, respectively. The ML approach provided similar biases (0.1 and 0.2 Gyr) but with a variance reduced by a factor of between two and four with respect to geometrical fit. The independent fit of single stars showed a very large variance. The most important difference between geometrical and ML approaches was the robustness against observational errors. For the geometrical method, we found that estimations starting from the same sample but with different Gaussian perturbations on the observables had about 0.3 Gyr random variability from one Monte Carlo run to another (45\% of the intrinsic variability due to observational errors). On the other hand, for the ML method, this value was about 65\% and 90\% of the simulations failed to include the true parameter values in their estimated 1 sigma credible interval. Finally, we compared the performance of the three fitting methods for single RGB-star age estimation. The variability owing to the choice of the fitting method was minor, being about 15\% of the variability caused by observational uncertainties.},

The mean proper motion of the cluster and the membership probabilities of the stars in the region of each cluster were determined by applying the statistical method in a modified fashion. In this study, we applied a global optimization procedure to fit the observed distribution of proper motions with two overlapping normal bivariate frequency functions, which also take the individual proper motion errors into account. For 724 clusters, this is the first determination of proper motion, and for the whole sample, we present results with a much larger number of identified astrometric member stars. Furthermore, it was possible to estimate the mean radial velocity of 364 clusters (102 unpublished so far) with the stellar membership using published radial velocity catalogs. These results provide an increase of 30\% and 19\% in the sample of open clusters with a determined mean absolute proper motion and mean radial velocity, respectively.

  abstract = {In \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ Doradus stars, the g-mode period spacing shows an approximately linear relation with period. The slope is a new asteroseismic diagnostic, related to the rotation rate and the azimuthal order \$m\$. We report two automated methods, the `moving-window Fourier transform' and the `cross-correlation', to detect and measure the period spacings based on four-year light curves from the \textbackslash{}textit\{Kepler\} satellite. The results show that the cross-correlation method performs better at detecting the period spacings and their slopes. In this paper, we apply our method to 22 \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ Dor stars with g-mode multiplets split by rotation. The rotation periods are similar to the g-mode period spacings, causing the multiplets to overlap. To clarify the overlapping patterns, we use the \textbackslash{}'echelle diagram and introduce a `copy-shift' diagram to discern and measure the splittings. The first observational relation between slopes and splittings is shown. The slope deviates from zero when the splitting increases, as the theory predicts. We found that what appears to be rotational splittings in two stars is in fact caused by two nearly-identical overlapping patterns from binaries.},

Most of these are large planets in short orbits around their host stars, although a small number of rocky planets are expected to be recovered. Most of these systems have only one known transiting planet; in only \textasciitilde{}5 percent of known multiply-transiting systems do we anticipate more than one planet to be recovered. When these planets are recovered, we expect TESS to be a powerful tool to characterizing transit timing variations. Using Kepler-88 (KOI-142) as an example, we show that TESS will improve measurements of planet-star mass ratios and orbital parameters, and significantly reduce the transit timing uncertainty in future years. Since TESS will be most sensitive to hot Jupiters, we research whether TESS will be able to detect tidal orbital decay in these systems. We find two confirmed planetary systems (Kepler-2 b and Kepler-13 b) and five candidate systems that will be good candidates to detect tidal decay.},

These are mass transfer from an evolved donor on to a main-sequence (MS) star in a close binary system, and direct collisions involving MS stars during binary encounters. We use the \textbackslash{}texttt\{FEWBODY\} code to perform simulations of single-binary and binary-binary interactions. This provides collisional velocity and mass distributions for comparison to the observed distributions. Most clusters are consistent with BSs derived from a dynamically relaxed population, supportive of the binary mass-transfer scenario. In a few clusters, including all the post-core collapse clusters in our sample, the collisional velocities provide the best fit.},

  shorttitle = {{{NGC}} 6791},
  abstract = {NGC 6791 is a unique stellar cluster, key to our understanding of both the multiple stellar population phenomenon and the evolution and assembly of the Galaxy. However, despite many investigations, its nature is still very controversial. Geisler et al. (2012) found evidence suggesting it was the first open cluster to possess multiple populations but several subsequent studies did not corroborate this. It has also been considered a member of the thin or thick disk or even the bulge, and both as an open or globular cluster or even the remnant of a dwarf galaxy. Here, we present and discuss detailed abundances derived from high resolution spectra obtained with UVES at VLT and HIRES at Keck of 17 evolved stars of this cluster. We obtained a mean [Fe/H]=+0.313+-0.005, in good agreement with recent estimates, and with no indication of star-to-star metallicity variation, as expected. We also did not find any variation in Na, in spite of having selected the very same stars as in Geisler et al. (2012), where a Na variation was claimed. This points to the presence of probable systematics in the lower resolution spectra of this very high metallicity cluster analysed in that work. In fact, we find no evidence for an intrinsic spread in any element, corroborating recent independent APOGEE data. The derived abundances indicate that NGC 6791 very likely formed in the Galactic Bulge and that the proposed association with the Thick Disk is unlikely, despite its present Galactic location. We confirm the most recent hypothesis suggesting that the cluster could have formed in the Bulge and radially migrated to its current location, which appears the best explanation for this intriguing object.},

Fitting theoretical isochrones with adopted values of the reddening and metallicity (E(B-V)=0.14, [Fe/H]=+0.09 dex) to the observed CMD yields a distance modulus of (m-M)\_\{0\}=11.93+/-0.10 and an age of \textasciitilde{}2.6 Gyr for NGC 6819. Our wide-field imaging reveals that NGC 6819 is larger in areal extent (R=13') than previously thought. The wide-field also benefits our estimate of the degree of field star contamination, and ultimately yields improved measurements of the structural parameters (r\_c=2.80', r\_t=38.2', and r\_h=7') and tidal mass of the cluster (M\_\{tid\}=3542.4 M(sun)). The flattened luminosity and mass functions indicate that NGC 6819 has experienced mass segregation as a result of its dynamical evolution. Our variability study of the cluster blue straggler star (BSS) population using the Welch-Stetson variability index (I\_\{WS\}) has revealed a number of variable BSS candidates.},

Formulae are obtained for the contribution of every star into the spatial density profile. The evaluation of spatial density profiles is tested against open-cluster models from N-body experiments with N = 500. Surface density profiles are derived for seven open clusters (NGC 1502, 1960, 2287, 2516, 2682, 6819 and 6939) using Two-Micron All-Sky Survey data and for different limiting magnitudes. The selection of an optimal kernel half-width is discussed. It is shown that open-cluster radius estimates hardly depend on the kernel half-width. Hints of stellar mass segregation and structural features indicating cluster non-stationarity in the regular force field are found. A comparison with other investigations shows that the data on open-cluster sizes are often underestimated. The existence of an extended corona around the open cluster NGC 6939 was confirmed. A combined function composed of the King density profile for the cluster core and the uniform sphere for the cluster corona is shown to be a better approximation of the surface radial density profile.The King function alone does not reproduce surface density profiles of sample clusters properly. The number of stars, the cluster masses and the tidal radii in the Galactic gravitational field for the sample clusters are estimated. It is shown that NGC 6819 and 6939 are extended beyond their tidal surfaces.},

  abstract = {For the vast majority of stars in the second Gaia data release, reliable distances cannot be obtained by inverting the parallax. A correct inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity of the transformation and the asymmetry of the resulting probability distribution. Here, we infer distances to essentially all 1.33 billion stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the physical properties of, or interstellar extinction toward, individual stars. We analyze the characteristics of the catalog and validate it using clusters.

(\texttildelow{}8 Gyr) and yet the most metal-rich cluster ([Fe/H] {$\simeq$} 0.4)
known in the Milky Way. By performing an orbital analysis within a
Galactic model including spiral arms and a bar, we found that it is
plausible that NGC 6791 formed in the inner thin disc or in the bulge,
and later displaced by radial migration to its current orbit. We apply
different tools to simulate NGC 6791, including direct N-body summation
in time-varying potentials, to test its survivability when going through
different Galactic environments. In order to survive the 8-Gyr journey
moving on a migrating orbit, NGC 6791 must have been more massive,
M0 {$\geq$} 5 \texttimes{} 104 M{$\odot$}, when
formed. We find independent confirmation of this initial mass in the
stellar mass function, which is observed to be flat; this can only be
explained if the average tidal field strength experienced by the cluster
is stronger than what it is at its current orbit. Therefore, the birth
place and journeys of NGC 6791 are imprinted in its chemical
composition, in its mass-loss and in its flat stellar mass function,
supporting its origin in the inner thin disc or in the bulge.},

  abstract = {Oscillation modes with a mixed character, as observed in evolved low-mass stars, are highly sensitive to the physical properties of the innermost regions. Measuring their properties is therefore extremely important to probe the core, but requires some care, due to the complexity of the mixed-mode pattern. This work aims at providing a consistent description of the mixed-mode pattern of low-mass stars, based on the asymptotic expansion. We also aim at studying the variation of the gravity offset \$\textbackslash{}varepsilon\_\{g\}\$ with stellar evolution. We revisit previous work about mixed modes in red giants and empirically test how period spacings, rotational splittings, mixed-mode widths and heights can be estimated in a consistent view, based on the properties of the mode inertia ratios. From the asymptotic fit of the mixed-mode pattern of a large set of red giants at various evolutionary stages, we derive unbiased and precise asymptotic parameters. As the asymptotic expansion of gravity modes is verified with a precision close to the frequency resolution for stars on the red giant branch (10\$\^\{-4\}\$ in relative values), we can derive accurate values of the asymptotic parameters. We decipher the complex pattern in a rapidly rotating star, and explain how asymmetrical splittings can be inferred, as well as the stellar inclinations. This allows us to revisit the stellar inclinations in two open clusters, NGC 6819 and NGC 6791: our results show that the stellar inclinations in these clusters do not have privileged orientation in the sky. The variation of the asymptotic gravity offset along with stellar evolution is investigated in detail. We also derive generic properties that explain under which conditions mixed modes can be observed.},

  shorttitle = {{{NGC}} 6791},
  abstract = {NGC 6791 is a unique stellar cluster, key to our understanding of both the multiple stellar population phenomenon and the evolution and assembly of the Galaxy. However, despite many investigations, its nature is still very controversial. Geisler et al. (2012) found evidence suggesting it was the first open cluster to possess multiple populations but several subsequent studies did not corroborate this. It has also been considered a member of the thin or thick disk or even the bulge, and both as an open or globular cluster or even the remnant of a dwarf galaxy. Here, we present and discuss detailed abundances derived from high resolution spectra obtained with UVES at VLT and HIRES at Keck of 17 evolved stars of this cluster. We obtained a mean [Fe/H]=+0.313+-0.005, in good agreement with recent estimates, and with no indication of star-to-star metallicity variation, as expected. We also did not find any variation in Na, in spite of having selected the very same stars as in Geisler et al. (2012), where a Na variation was claimed. This points to the presence of probable systematics in the lower resolution spectra of this very high metallicity cluster analysed in that work. In fact, we find no evidence for an intrinsic spread in any element, corroborating recent independent APOGEE data. The derived abundances indicate that NGC 6791 very likely formed in the Galactic Bulge and that the proposed association with the Thick Disk is unlikely, despite its present Galactic location. We confirm the most recent hypothesis suggesting that the cluster could have formed in the Bulge and radially migrated to its current location, which appears the best explanation for this intriguing object.},

We couple the new MESA Isochrone and Stellar Tracks (MIST) models to the Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis (FSPS) package, extending the stellar population synthesis models to include the contributions from very massive stars ({$>$} 100 \{M\}{$\odot$}
), which can be significant in the first \texttildelow{}4 Myr after a
starburst. These models predict ionizing luminosities that are
consistent with recent observations of young nuclear star clusters. We also construct composite stellar populations assuming a distribution of initial rotation rates. Even in low-metallicity environments where rotation has a significant effect on the evolution of massive stars, we find that stellar population models require a significant contribution from fast-rotating (v/\{v\}\{crit\}{$>$} 0.4) stars in order to sustain the production of ionizing photons beyond a few Myr following a starburst. These results have potentially important implications for cosmic reionization by massive stars and the interpretation of nebular emission lines in high-redshift star-forming galaxies.},

  abstract = {An extensive grid of metal-rich isochrones utilizing the latest available input physics has been calculated for comparison with the old, metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791. The isochrones have been
simultaneously fitted to BV and VI color-magnitude diagrams, with the same composition, reddening, and distance modulus required for both colors. Our best-fitting isochrone assumes [Fe/H]=+0.4, scaled solar abundance ratios, and DeltaY/DeltaZ=2 (Y=0.31), yielding an excellent fit to the data at all points along the major sequences. The resulting age is 8 Gyr, with E(B-V)=0.10 and (m-M)\_V=13.42. The derived cluster parameters are fairly robust to variations in the isochrone [Fe/H] and helium abundances. All the acceptable fits indicate that
0.08{$<$}=E(B-V){$<$}=0.13 and 13.30{$<$}=(m-M)\_V{$<$}=13.45 and that NGC
6791 has an age of 8.0+/-0.5 Gyr. The fits also suggest that
DeltaY/DeltaZ lies between 1 and 3. A metallicity as low as solar is clearly ruled out, as is DeltaY/DeltaZ=0. Comparison with previous isochrone studies indicates that the derived reddening is primarily due to our use of the most recent color transformations, whereas the age depends on both the colors and the input physics. Our isochrones provide an excellent fit to the Hyades zero-age main sequence as determined by Hipparcos, providing evidence that our derived reddening and distance modulus are reliable.},

We implement a multi-wavelength approach to studying the X-ray sources, utilizing X-ray and UV data from XMM observations along with the wealth of photometry and radial-velocity data from the WIYN Open Cluster Study and the CFHT Open Cluster Survey. Within the cluster half-light radius, we detect 12 X-ray sources down to a luminosity of 1030 erg s-1 for cluster members. The sources include a candidate quiescent low-mass X-ray binary (qLMXB), a candidate cataclysmic variable, and two active binary systems. The presence of a qLMXB in an open cluster is previously unexpected given the known relationships between luminous X-ray sources and encounter frequency in globular clusters, and most likely has a dynamical origin.},

  abstract = {Individual mode frequencies have been detected in thousands of individual solar-like oscillators on the red giant branch (RGB). Fitting stellar models to these mode frequencies, however, is more difficult than in main-sequence stars. This is partly because of the uncertain magnitude of the surface effect: the systematic difference between observed and modelled frequencies caused by poor modelling of the near-surface layers. We aim to study the magnitude of the surface effect in RGB stars. Surface effect corrections used for main-sequence targets are potentially large enough to put the non-radial mixed modes in RGB stars out of order, which is unphysical. Unless this can be circumvented, model-fitting of evolved RGB stars is restricted to the radial modes, which reduces the number of available modes. Here, we present a method to suppress gravity modes (g-modes) in the cores of our stellar models, so that they have only pure pressure modes (p-modes). We show that the method gives unbiased results and apply it to three RGB solar-like oscillators in double-lined eclipsing binaries: KIC 8410637, KIC 9540226 and KIC 5640750. In all three stars, the surface effect decreases the model frequencies consistently by about 0.1\textendash{}0.3 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz at the frequency of maximum oscillation power {$\nu$}max, which agrees with existing predictions from three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. Though our method in essence discards information about the stellar cores, it provides a useful step forward in understanding the surface effect in RGB stars.},

The calculations adopt a time-dependent non-local convection model, with the turbulent pressure profile being calibrated to results of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar atmospheres. The linewidths are obtained from extensive peakbagging of Kepler light curves. These observational results are of unprecedented quality owing to the long continuous observations by Kepler. The uniqueness of the Kepler mission also means that, for asteroseismic properties, this is the best data that will be available for a long time to come. We therefore take great care in modelling nine RGB stars in NGC 6819 using information from 3D simulations to obtain realistic temperature stratifications and calibrated turbulent pressure profiles. Our modelled damping rates reproduce well the Kepler observations, including the characteristic depression in the linewidths around the frequency of maximum oscillation power. Furthermore, we thoroughly test the sensitivity of the calculated damping rates to changes in the parameters of the non-local convection model.},

These trends are modelled using the publicly available co-trending basis vectors, within an (approximate) Bayesian framework with `shrinkage' priors to minimize the risk of overfitting and the injection of any additional noise into the corrected light curves, while keeping any astrophysical signals intact. We show that the ARC2 pipeline's performance matches that of the standard Kepler PDC-MAP data products using standard noise metrics, and demonstrate its ability to preserve astrophysical signals using injection tests with simulated stellar rotation and planetary transit signals. Although it is not identical, the ARC2 pipeline can thus be used as an open-source alternative to PDC-MAP, whenever the ability to model the impact of the systematics removal process on other kinds of signal is important.},

  abstract = {Among the available methods for dating stars, gyrochronology is a powerful one because it requires knowledge of only the star's mass and rotation period. Gyrochronology relations have previously been calibrated using young clusters, with the Sun providing the only age dependence, and are therefore poorly calibrated at late ages. We used rotation period measurements of 310 Kepler stars with asteroseismic ages, 50 stars from the Hyades and Coma Berenices clusters and 6 field stars (including the Sun) with precise age measurements to calibrate the gyrochronology relation, whilst fully accounting for measurement uncertainties in all observable quantities. We calibrated a relation of the form P = An \texttimes{} (B - V - c)b, where P is rotation period in days, A is age in Myr, B and V are magnitudes and a, b and n are the free parameters of our model. We found a = 0.40+-00..305, b = 0.31+-00..0052 and n = 0.55+-00..0029. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were used to explore the posterior probability distribution functions of the gyrochronology parameters and we carefully checked the effects of leaving out parts of our sample, leading us to find that no single relation between rotation period, colour and age can adequately describe all the subsets of our data. The Kepler asteroseismic stars, cluster stars and local field stars cannot all be described by the same gyrochronology relation. The Kepler asteroseismic stars may be subject to observational biases; however, the clusters show unexpected deviations from the predicted behaviour, providing concerns for the overall reliability of gyrochronology as a dating method.},

These results are incompatible with the nature of ``pure'' stochastic excitation as observed in solar-like stars. Nonetheless, one point is certain: the opacity mechanism alone cannot explain the oscillation spectrum of HD 187547. Here we present new theoretical investigations showing that convection dynamics can intrinsically excite coherent pulsations in the chemically peculiar {$\delta$} Scuti star HD 187547. More precisely, it is the perturbations of the mean Reynold stresses (turbulent pressure) that drives the pulsations and the excitation takes place predominantly in the hydrogen ionization zone.},

Following this categorisation, the power spectra of the 61 main-sequence and subgiant stars were analysed using both maximum likelihood estimators and Bayesian estimators, providing individual mode characteristics such as frequencies, linewidths, and mode heights.

Results. We report on the mode linewidth at both maximum power and maximum mode height for these 42 stars as a function of effective temperature.
Conclusions. We show that the mode linewidth at either maximum mode height or maximum amplitude follows a scaling relation with effective temperature, which is a combination of a power law and a lower bound. The typical power-law index is about 13 for the linewidth derived from the maximum mode height, and about 16 for the linewidth derived from the maximum amplitude, while the lower bound is about 0.3 {$\mu$}Hz and 0.7 {$\mu$}Hz, respectively. We stress that this scaling relation is only valid for cool main-sequence stars and subgiants, and does not have any predictive power outside the temperature range of these stars.},

The eight stars form two groups with very different oscillation power spectra; the four stars with the lowest {$\Delta\nu$} values display rich sets of mixed l=1 modes, while this is not the case for the four stars with higher {$\Delta\nu$}. For the four stars with lowest {$\Delta\nu$}, we determine the asymptotic period spacing of the mixed modes, {$\Delta$}P, which together with the masses we derive for all eight stars suggest that they belong to the so-called secondary clump. Based on the global oscillation parameters, we present initial theoretical stellar modeling that indicates that we can constrain convective-core overshoot on the main sequence and in the helium-burning phase for these {$\sim$}2 Me stars.

  issn = {0035-8711, 1365-2966},
  abstract = {Individual mode frequencies have been detected in thousands of individual solar-like oscillators on the red giant branch (RGB). Fitting stellar models to these mode frequencies, however, is more difficult than in main-sequence stars. This is partly because of the uncertain magnitude of the surface effect: the systematic difference between observed and modelled frequencies caused by poor modelling of the near-surface layers. We aim to study the magnitude of the surface effect in RGB stars. Surface effect corrections used for main-sequence targets are potentially large enough to put the non-radial mixed modes in RGB stars out of order, which is unphysical. Unless this can be circumvented, model fitting of evolved RGB stars is restricted to the radial modes, which reduces the number of available modes. Here, we present a method to suppress gravity modes (g-modes) in the cores of our stellar models, so that they have only pure pressure modes (p-modes). We show that the method gives unbiased results and apply it to three RGB solar-like oscillators in double-lined eclipsing binaries: KIC 8410637, KIC 9540226, and KIC 5640750. In all three stars, the surface effect decreases the model frequencies consistently by about 0.1\textendash{}0.3 {$\mu$}Hz at the frequency of maximum oscillation power {$\nu$}max, which agrees with existing predictions from three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations. Though our method in essence discards information about the stellar cores, it provides a useful step forward in understanding the surface effect in RGB stars.},

  abstract = {We present the characterization of the Kepler-93 exoplanetary system, based on three years of photometry gathered by the Kepler spacecraft. The duration and cadence of the Kepler observations, in tandem with the brightness of the star, enable unusually precise constraints on both the planet and its host. We conduct an asteroseismic analysis of the Kepler photometry and conclude that the star has an average density of 1.652 {$\pm$} 0.006 g cm-3. Its mass of 0.911 {$\pm$} 0.033 M renders it one of the lowest-mass subjects of asteroseismic study. An analysis of the transit signature produced by the planet Kepler-93b, which appears with a period of 4.72673978 {$\pm$} 9.7 \texttimes{} 10-7 days, returns a consistent but less precise measurement of the stellar density, 1.72+-00..0228 g cm-3. The agreement of these two values lends credence to the planetary interpretation of the transit signal. The achromatic transit depth, as compared between Kepler and the Spitzer Space Telescope, supports the same conclusion. We observed seven transits of Kepler-93b with Spitzer, three of which we conducted in a new observing mode. The pointing strategy we employed to gather this subset of observations halved our uncertainty on the transit radius ratio RP /R . We find, after folding together the stellar radius measurement of 0.919 {$\pm$} 0.011 R with the transit depth, a best-fit value for the planetary radius of 1.481 {$\pm$} 0.019 R{$\oplus$}. The uncertainty of 120 km on our measurement of the planet's size currently renders it one of the most precisely measured planetary radii outside of the solar system. Together with the radius, the planetary mass of 3.8 {$\pm$} 1.5 M{$\oplus$} corresponds to a rocky density of 6.3 {$\pm$} 2.6 g cm-3. After applying a prior on the plausible maximum densities of similarly sized worlds between 1 and 1.5 R{$\oplus$}, we find that Kepler-93b possesses an average density within this group.},

  abstract = {Optical flares on early F- and A-type stars have never been observed with certainty. Inspection of several thousands of these stars in the Kepler public archives resulted in the discovery of flares in 25 G-type and 27 F-type stars. Because A-type stars are thought not to be active, the detection of flares on 19 A-type stars from a sample of nearly 2000 A stars is particularly noteworthy. The flares have relative intensities in the range 1\textendash{}100 parts per thousand and typical durations of a few minutes to several hours. The mean interval between flares varies between 1 and 120 days. We estimate the typical energy of flares to be around 1035 erg in the F-type stars and about 1036 erg in the A-type stars. Nearly all these stars vary at a low level with a period which is most likely the rotational period of the star. Comparison of the relative flare intensities with those in cool red stars observed by Kepler shows that flares in these stars, and certainly in the A-type stars, cannot easily be ascribed to cool flare-star companions. The huge energy released in the flares is difficult to understand. This is especially the case for A-type stars since these stars are thought to have very weak magnetic fields. The flare energy may possibly originate in magnetic reconnection of field lines between the primary star and a companion.},

If we assume that the photometric period is the period of rotation, we can derive the equatorial rotational velocity from a suitable radius estimate. It turns out that the distribution of equatorial velocities derived in this way is similar to the distribution of equatorial velocities of A-type main-sequence stars in the general field derived from spectroscopic line broadening, verifying our initial assumption. We suggest that the light variation is due to rotational modulation caused by starspots or some other corotating structure. In many stars the rotation peak in the periodogram has a characteristic shape which is not understood. The light amplitudes are highly variable. We deduce from the amplitude distribution that the sizes of starspots in A-type stars are similar to the largest sunspots. From the widths of the peaks in the periodogram we deduce that differential rotation in these stars is similar to that in the Sun. We find that the period\textendash{}colour relationship used for gyrochronology in late-type stars extends to early F-type and probably late A-type stars as well. Flares in A-type stars have been recently detected. We add 13 additional A-type flare stars to this sample, which means that about 1.5 per cent of A-type stars in the Kepler field show flares.

We investigate the possibility that the periodicity is due to rotation, pulsation or an orbital effect. We argue that neither rotation nor pulsation can provide a suitable, testable, explanation.

We find that multiple peaks in the range 0\textendash{}5 d-1 are found in nearly all {$\delta$} Scuti stars, even those well outside the blue edge of the {$\gamma$} Doradus instability strip. All {$\delta$} Sct stars are essentially {$\delta$} Sct/{$\gamma$} Dor hybrids. The reason why this fact was not recognized from groundbased observations is due to the fact that the low frequencies reach maximum amplitude close to the blue edge of the {$\gamma$} Dor instability strip. Stars which do not have high frequencies characteristic of {$\delta$} Sct pulsations also do not have low frequencies. The amplitudes of the low frequencies correlate with the amplitudes of the {$\delta$} Sct pulsations. The low frequencies have long lifetimes similar to those of the {$\delta$} Sct modes. They are therefore not excited by a stochastic mechanism. We show that the low frequencies cannot be explained as non-linear combinations of {$\delta$} Sct modes. By comparing the observed distribution of frequencies with those from {$\delta$} Sct models, we show that low-frequency peaks cannot be explained as a result of rotational perturbation of high-frequency {$\delta$} Sct modes. We find that the number of lowfrequency peaks increases with rotation, but Rossby and Kelvin modes can be ruled out as possible candidates. The presence of low frequencies in A stars would be explained if the convective blocking mechanism continues to be active even in the hottest A stars.},

  abstract = {From Kepler data, we show that the incidence of flares on stars drops by only a factor of 4 from K\textendash{}M dwarfs to A\textendash{}F stars. Allowing for visibility effects, this implies that the true relative number of flare stars does not change very much from cool dwarfs to hot A stars. The idea that flares on A stars can be attributed to a cool companion has to be rejected because it leads to flare amplitudes two orders of magnitude smaller than actually observed. We confirm that spots on flare stars are generally larger than those on non-flare stars and that flare stars rotate significantly faster than non-flare stars. Analysis of 209 flare stars observed in Kepler short-cadence mode allows accurate measurements of flare shapes and duration. We find that about one-third of the flares have a bump or slope discontinuity on the decaying branch and that flares of long duration are to be found in stars with low surface gravities. Flare energies are strongly correlated with stellar luminosity and radius. The correlation with radius leads to a rough estimate of several tens of gauss for the typical magnetic field associated with a flare. The correlation with stellar luminosity can be understood if the typical flare loop length-scales approximately as the stellar radius. We examined the flare frequency as a function of orbital phase in three eclipsing binaries in which a large number of flares are visible. There appears to be no correlation of flaring with orbital phase, which weakens the hypothesis that flares in close binaries could be a result of reconnection of field lines connecting the two stars.},

  issn = {0035-8711, 1365-2966},
  abstract = {Two different mechanisms may act to induce quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) in whole-disc observations of stellar flares. One mechanism may be magnetohydromagnetic forces and other processes acting on flare loops as seen in the Sun. The other mechanism may be forced local acoustic oscillations due to the high-energy particle impulse generated by the flare (known as `sunquakes' in the Sun). We analyse short-cadence Kepler data of 257 flares in 75 stars to search for QPP in the flare decay branch or post-flare oscillations which may be attributed to either of these two mechanisms. About 18 per cent of stellar flares show a distinct bump in the flare decay branch of unknown origin. The bump does not seem to be a highly damped global oscillation because the periods of the bumps derived from wavelet analysis do not correlate with any stellar parameter. We detected damped oscillations covering several cycles (QPP), in seven flares on five stars. The periods of these oscillations also do not correlate with any stellar parameter, suggesting that these may be a due to flare loop oscillations. We searched for forced global oscillations which might result after a strong flare. To this end, we investigated the behaviour of the amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in eight stars before and after a flare. However, no clear amplitude change could be detected. We also analysed the amplitudes of the self-excited pulsations in two {$\delta$} Scuti stars and one {$\gamma$} Doradus star before and after a flare. Again, no clear amplitude changes were found. Our conclusions are that a new process needs to be found to explain the high incidence of bumps in stellar flare light curves, that flare loop oscillations may have been detected in a few stars and that no conclusive evidence exists as yet for flare induced global acoustic oscillations (starquakes).},

  abstract = {Short-cadence observations of {$\delta$} Scuti stars in the Kepler field are used to investigate the physical nature of high-amplitude {$\delta$} Scuti stars (HADS). Although it is often mentioned that HADS are transition objects between classical Cepheids and {$\delta$} Scuti stars, neither ground-based or space-based observations support this view. It is found that HADS occur randomly within the instability strip. The possibility that HADS may be defined by the presence of combination frequencies is discussed. There is a weak tendency for the number of combination frequencies to increase with increasing amplitude of the parent frequencies. However, even stars with very low amplitudes may have detectable combination frequencies. Very few parent modes have a period ratio appropriate to first-overtone and fundamental radial modes. It appears that a high amplitude, in itself, is not useful as a distinguishing feature of {$\delta$} Scuti stars.},

  abstract = {KIC 5123889 was observed by Kepler almost continuously over a 4-yr period in long-cadence mode. The periodogram shows 14 low-frequency peaks spaced at almost exactly equidistant periods that are shown to be dipole gravity modes. Because the period spacing is practically constant, it can be deduced that the internal rotation period is probably in excess of 1 yr, allowing non-rotating models to be used for frequency matching. For a given metallicity and overshoot parameter, there is a strong correlation between the period spacing and the effective temperature in models covering the main-sequence band. The periods of all 14 dipole modes can be matched with the models to a precision of about 0.1 per cent. In addition, 51 peaks with frequencies in the range 1.7\textendash{}2.8 d-1 are identified as combinations of the dipole mode frequencies. Four peaks in the frequency range 12.7\textendash{}18.5 d-1, two of which have high amplitudes, identify the star as a {$\delta$} Scuti. An attempt to fit the high frequencies using the restrictions imposed by the dipole gravity modes is not convincing as no unique identification can be made. Combination frequencies involving the {$\delta$} Scuti frequencies and the dipole modes are also present.},

The problem of low frequencies in {$\delta$} Sct stars, which occurs in over 98 percent of these stars, is discussed. Gaia DR2 parallaxes were used to obtain precise luminosities, enabling the instability strips of the two classes of variable to be precisely defined. Surprisingly, it turns out that the instability region of the {$\gamma$} Dor stars is entirely within the {$\delta$} Sct instability strip. Thus, {$\gamma$} Dor stars should not be considered a separate class of variable. The observed red and blue edges of the instability strip do not agree with recent model calculations. Stellar pulsation occurs in less than half of the stars in the instability region and arguments are presented to show that this cannot be explained by assuming pulsation at a level too low to be detected. Precise Gaia DR2 luminosities of high-amplitude {$\delta$} Sct stars (HADS) show that most of these are normal {$\delta$} Sct stars and not transition objects. It is argued that current ideas on A star envelopes need to be revised.},

A subset of these stars have a larger light amplitude and asymmetric light curves with larger variation in maximum brightness than in minimum brightness. The beating is mostly a result of two dominant, closely spaced frequencies. A third group of stars shows multiple low frequencies of comparable amplitudes. All three types of star fall in the region of the Hertzsprung\textendash{}Russell diagram where {$\gamma$} Dor stars are found and we therefore identify them as {$\gamma$} Dor variables. However, stars with migrating star-spots also have symmetric light curves with beats, so it is likely that the sample is contaminated by non-pulsating stars of this type. If we assume that the dominant frequency in stars with beats is the rotational frequency, the resulting distribution of equatorial rotational velocities matches that of field stars of similar temperature and luminosity. We therefore conclude that the pulsation periods of these stars must be close to their rotational periods. The third group with multiple frequencies may be slowly rotating {$\gamma$} Dor stars. This investigation is closely related to the presence of low frequencies in {$\delta$} Scuti stars which we briefly discuss.},

The light curve shows rotational variations from surface spots with a period of 4.303 {$\pm$} 0.002 d, an amplitude of about 6 mmag and eight pulsation frequencies typical of roAp stars. The high-frequency pattern consists of a quintuplet of equally spaced peaks where the frequency of the dominant central peak (68 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}mag amplitude) is 1353.00 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz (P = 12.32 min). A second set of three peaks of lower amplitude are also visible. These appear to form part of a quintuplet centred on 1511.6 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz with the central peak and one side peak missing. The equidistant frequency spacing is 2.69 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz, which corresponds to the 4.303 d rotation period. However, the amplitudes (12 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}mag) of these peaks are too close to the detection level to allow definite identification of the multiplets. Although no spectrum is available, the character of the pulsations shows that this is a roAp star with two high-frequency modes modulated in amplitude in accordance with the oblique pulsator model. The 4.303-d variation in the light curve, which is interpreted as rotational modulation, shows harmonics as high as the 26th. These harmonics are probably a result of many patches of varying surface brightness associated with surface abundance variations characteristic of Ap stars.},

We find that the light curves of 39 per cent of these stars can be described by a low-frequency sinusoid and its harmonic, usually with variable amplitude, which we interpret as rotational modulation. A large fraction (32 stars or 28 per cent) might be classified as ellipsoidal variables, but a statistical argument suggests that these are probably rotational variables as well. Ten stars (8 per cent of the total) have a peculiar periodogram feature which is common among A stars. The physical cause of this feature is unknown but very likely related to rotation. The large number of rotating variables suggests that star-spots are common in B stars and indicates that magnetic fields can be generated in radiative stellar envelopes. We find five stars (4 per cent) to be {$\beta$} Cep (BECP) variables, all of which have low frequencies with relatively large amplitudes. The presence of low frequencies in BECP stars is an unsolved problem. There are 21 stars (18 per cent) with multiple low frequencies which could be described as slowly pulsating B (SPB) variables. Other pulsating stars do not fit into the general definition of BECP or SPB variables in that they are cool but pulsate with high frequencies. We assume that these are further examples of the anomalous pulsating stars which in the past have been called `Maia' variables. There are 11 stars (10 per cent) of this type. We also examined 300 B stars observed in the K2 Campaign 0 field. We find 12 BECP/Maia candidates and 15 SPB variables.},

We obtained the true distribution of equatorial rotational velocities in each region and calculated the frequency distributions predicted by pulsation models, taking into account rotational splitting of the frequencies. We confirm that rotation cannot account for the presence of low frequencies. We calculated a large variety of standard pulsation models with different metal and helium abundances, but were unable to obtain unstable low-frequency modes driven by the {$\kappa$} mechanism in any model. We also constructed models with modified opacities in the envelope. Increasing the opacity at a temperature log T = 5.06 by a factor of 2 does lead to instability of low-degree modes at low frequencies, but also decreases the frequency range of {$\delta$} Sct-type pulsations to some extent. We also re-affirm the fact that less than half of the stars in the {$\delta$} Sct instability strip have pulsations detectable by Kepler. We also point out the huge variety of frequency patterns in stars with roughly similar parameters, suggesting that non-linearity is an important factor in {$\delta$} Sct pulsations.},

  abstract = {Two different mechanisms may act to induce quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) in whole-disc observations of stellar flares. One mechanism may be magnetohydromagnetic forces and other processes acting on flare loops as seen in the Sun. The other mechanism may be forced local acoustic oscillations due to the high-energy particle impulse generated by the flare (known as `sunquakes' in the Sun). We analyse short-cadence Kepler data of 257 flares in 75 stars to search for QPP in the flare decay branch or post-flare oscillations which may be attributed to either of these two mechanisms. About 18 per cent of stellar flares show a distinct bump in the flare decay branch of unknown origin. The bump does not seem to be a highly damped global oscillation because the periods of the bumps derived from wavelet analysis do not correlate with any stellar parameter. We detected damped oscillations covering several cycles (QPP), in seven flares on five stars. The periods of these oscillations also do not correlate with any stellar parameter, suggesting that these may be a due to flare loop oscillations. We searched for forced global oscillations which might result after a strong flare. To this end, we investigated the behaviour of the amplitudes of solar-like oscillations in eight stars before and after a flare. However, no clear amplitude change could be detected. We also analysed the amplitudes of the self-excited pulsations in two {$\delta$} Scuti stars and one {$\gamma$} Doradus star before and after a flare. Again, no clear amplitude changes were found. Our conclusions are that a new process needs to be found to explain the high incidence of bumps in stellar flare light curves, that flare loop oscillations may have been detected in a few stars and that no conclusive evidence exists as yet for flare induced global acoustic oscillations (starquakes).},

We compare the location of these stars in the Hertzsprung\textendash{}Russell (HR) diagram with that calculated by linear, non-adiabatic pulsation models. There is generally a good agreement and it appears that many of the hotter {$\delta$} Scuti stars are pulsating in overtones as high as radial order n = 8. Models predict unstable modes of intermediate and high spherical harmonic, l, which are trapped in the envelope. The instability strip for these modes extends well beyond the blue edge for l {$\leq$} 4 and should be visible in the Kepler data. However, stars with these predicted properties are not seen. Moreover, we find that the observed frequency range does not agree with the models. Another challenge is to understand why more than half of the stars in the {$\delta$} Sct instability strip are not pulsating. The distribution of amplitudes argues strongly against the notion that the pulsation amplitudes are below the Kepler detection limit. The mode density of {$\delta$} Scuti stars is surprisingly low and suggests that modes of a high degree are not common. We do not find any stars with mode densities as high as that found in the CoRoT observations of HD 50844. The periodograms of stars in the same part of the HR diagram vary widely. However, we have identified a group of {$\delta$} Scuti stars characterized by a single dominant frequency in which a period\textendash{}luminosity law is present.

Here we present an overview of M giant variability on a wide range of time-scales (hours to years), based on the analysis of 13 quarters of Kepler long-cadence observations (one point per every 29.4 min), with a total time-span of over 1000 d. About two-thirds of the sample stars have been selected from the All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS)-North survey of the Kepler field, with the rest supplemented from a randomly chosen M giant control sample. We first describe the correction of the light curves from different quarters, which was found to be essential. We use Fourier analysis to calculate multiple frequencies for all stars in the sample. Over 50 stars show a relatively strong signal with a period equal to the Kepler-year and a characteristic phase dependence across the whole field of view. We interpret this as a so far unidentified systematic effect in the Kepler data. We discuss the presence of regular patterns in the distribution of multiple periodicities and amplitudes. In the period\textendash{}amplitude plane we find that it is possible to distinguish between solar-like oscillations and larger amplitude pulsations which are characteristic for Mira/semiregular stars. This may indicate the region of the transition between two types of oscillations as we move upward along the giant branch.},

  abstract = {CoRoT and Kepler high-precision photometric data allowed the detection and characterization of the oscillation parameters in stars other than the Sun. Moreover, thanks to the scaling relations, it is possible to estimate masses and radii for thousands of solar-type oscillating stars. Recently, a {$\increment\nu$} - {$\rho$} relation has been found for {$\delta$} Scuti stars. Now, analysing several hundreds of this kind of stars observed with CoRoT and Kepler, we present an empiric relation between their frequency at maximum power of their oscillation spectra and their effective temperature. Such a relation can be explained with the help of the {$\kappa$}-mechanism and the observed dispersion of the residuals is compatible with they being caused by the gravity-darkening effect.},

We have obtained ground-based radial velocity observations from the Hobby\textendash{}Eberly Telescope and unambiguously confirm the planetary nature of Kepler-91b by simultaneously modeling the Kepler and radial velocity data. The star exhibits temporally correlated noise due to stellar granulation which we model as a Gaussian Process. We hypothesize that it is this noise component that led previous studies to suspect Kepler-91b to be a false positive.

This data set constitutes an unprecedented study of stellar variability given its great precision and complete time coverage (with a half hour cadence). Because the full Kepler pipeline is not currently suitable for a study of stellar variability of this sort, we describe our procedures for treating the ``raw'' pipeline data. About half of the total sample exhibits convincing periodic variability up to two weeks, with amplitudes ranging from differential intensity changes of less than 10-4 up to more than 10\%. K and M dwarfs have a greater fraction of period behavior than G dwarfs. The giants in the sample have distinctive quasi-periodic behavior, but are not periodic in the way we define it. Not all periodicities are due to rotation, and the most significant period is not necessarily the rotation period. We discuss properties of the light curves, and in particular look at a sample of very clearly periodic G dwarfs. It is clear that a large number of them do vary because of rotation and starspots, but it will take further analysis to fully exploit this.},

We define a diagnostic that characterizes the median differential intensity change between data bins of a given timescale. We apply the same diagnostics to Solar and Heliospheric Observatory data that has been rendered comparable to Kepler. The Sun exhibits similar photometric variability on all timescales as comparable solar-type stars in the Kepler field. The previously defined photometric ``range'' serves as our activity proxy (driven by starspot coverage). We revisit the fraction of comparable stars in the Kepler field that are more active than the Sun. The exact active fraction depends on what is meant by ``more active than the Sun'' and on the magnitude limit of the sample of stars considered. This active fraction is between a quarter and a third (depending on the timescale). We argue that a reliable result requires timescales of half a day or longer and stars brighter than MKep of 14, otherwise non-stellar noise distorts it. We also analyze main sequence stars grouped by temperature from 6500 to 3500 K. As one moves to cooler stars, the active fraction of stars becomes steadily larger (greater than 90\% for early M dwarfs). The Sun is a good photometric model at all timescales for those cooler stars that have long-term variability within the span of solar variability.},

Here, we use flicker measurements of 289 bright (Kepmag {$<$} 13) candidate planet-hosting stars with Teff = 4500\textendash{}6650 K to re-assess the stellar parameters and determine the resulting impact on derived planet properties. This re-assessment reveals that for the brightest planet-host stars, Malmquist bias contaminates the stellar sample with evolved stars: nearly 50\% of the bright planet-host stars are subgiants.

We newly derive rotation periods from the Kepler light curves for all of the stars in our study sample. The RV variations reported herein range from less than 4 to 135 m s-1, yet the stars all have amplitudes of photometric variability less than 3 mmag, reflecting the preference of the RV program for chromospherically ``quiet'' stars. Despite the small size of our sample, we find with high statistical significance that the RV rms manifests strongly in the Fourier power spectrum of the light curve: stars that are noisier in RV have a greater number of frequency components in the light curve. We also find that spot models of the observed light curves systematically underpredict the observed RV variations by factors of {$\sim$}2\textendash{}1000, likely because the low-level photometric variations in our sample are driven by processes not included in simple spot models. The stars best fit by these models tend to have simpler light curves, dominated by a single relatively high-amplitude component of variability. Finally, we demonstrate that the RV rms behavior of our sample can be explained in the context of the photometric variability evolutionary diagram introduced by Bastien et al. We use this diagram to derive the surface gravities of the stars in our sample, revealing many of them to have moved off the main sequence. More generally, we find that the stars with the largest RV rms are those that have evolved onto the ``flicker floor'' sequence in that diagram, characterized by relatively low amplitude but highly complex photometric variations which grow as the stars evolve to become subgiants.},

The average mass of stars on the RGB of NGC 6791 is 1.20 {$\pm$} 0.01 M , while that of NGC 6819 is 1.68 {$\pm$} 0.03 M . It should be noted that we do not have data that cover the entire RGB and the actual mass will be somewhat lower. We have determined model-dependent estimates of ages of these clusters. We find ages between 6.8 and 8.6 Gyr for NGC 6791, however, most sets of models give ages around 7 Gyr. We obtain ages between 2 and 2.4 Gyr for NGC 6819.},

  abstract = {NASA's Kepler Mission uses transit photometry to determine the frequency of Earth-size planets in or near the habitable zone of Sun-like stars. The mission reached a milestone toward meeting that goal: the discovery of its first rocky planet, Kepler-10b. Two distinct sets of transit events were detected: (1) a 152 {$\pm$} 4 ppm dimming lasting 1.811 {$\pm$} 0.024 hr with ephemeris T [BJD] = 2454964.57375+-00..0000006802 + N {${_\ast}$} 0.837495+-00..000000000045 days and (2) a 376 {$\pm$} 9 ppm dimming lasting 6.86 {$\pm$} 0.07 hr with ephemeris T [BJD] = 2454971.6761+-00..00002203 + N {${_\ast}$} 45.29485+-00..0000006756 days. Statistical tests on the photometric and pixel flux time series established the viability of the planet candidates triggering ground-based follow-up observations. Forty precision Doppler measurements were used to confirm that the short-period transit event is due to a planetary companion. The parent star is bright enough for asteroseismic analysis. Photometry was collected at 1 minute cadence for {$>$}4 months from which we detected 19 distinct pulsation frequencies. Modeling the frequencies resulted in precise knowledge of the fundamental stellar properties. Kepler10 is a relatively old (11.9 {$\pm$} 4.5 Gyr) but otherwise Sun-like main-sequence star with Teff = 5627 {$\pm$} 44 K, M = 0.895 {$\pm$} 0.060 M , and R = 1.056 {$\pm$} 0.021 R . Physical models simultaneously fit to the transit light curves and the precision Doppler measurements yielded tight constraints on the properties of Kepler-10b that speak to its rocky composition: MP = 4.56+-11..1279 M{$\oplus$}, RP = 1.416+-00..003336 R{$\oplus$}, and {$\rho$}P = 8.8+-22..19 g cm-3.

  abstract = {Methods. We applied asteroseismic techniques to determine the masses and radii of the primary component of each system. For a selected target, light and radial velocity curve modelling techniques were applied to extract the parameters of the system and its primary component. Stellar evolution and its effects on the evolution of the binary system were studied from theoretical models.
Results. The paper presents the asteroseismic analysis of 18 pulsating red giants in eccentric binary systems, for which masses and radii were constrained. The orbital periods of these systems range from 20 to 440 days. The results of our ongoing radial velocity monitoring programme with the Hermes spectrograph reveal an eccentricity range of e = 0.2 to 0.76. As a case study we present a detailed analysis of KIC 5006817, whose rich oscillation spectrum allows for detailed seismic analysis. From seismology we constrain the rotational period of the envelope to be at least 165 d, which is roughly twice the orbital period. The stellar core rotates 13 times faster than the surface. From the spectrum and radial velocities we expect that the Doppler beaming signal should have a maximum amplitude of 300 ppm in the light curve. Fixing the mass and radius to the asteroseismically determined values, we find from our binary modelling a value of the gravity darkening exponent that is significantly larger than expected. Through binary modelling, we determine the mass of the secondary component to be 0.29 {$\pm$} 0.03 M .
Conclusions. For KIC 5006817 we exclude pseudo-synchronous rotation of the red giant with the orbit. The comparison of the results from seismology and modelling of the light curve shows a possible alignment of the rotational and orbital axis at the 2{$\sigma$} level. Red giant eccentric systems could be progenitors of cataclysmic variables and hot subdwarf B stars.},

  abstract = {Methods. We acquire high-resolution and high signal-to-noise (S/N) spectroscopy to construct three solar reference spectra by observing the reflected light of the asteroids Vesta and Victoria and the jovian moon Europa (100 {$<\sim$} S /N {$<\sim$} 450) with the HERMES spectrograph. We then observe the Kepler solar analogue KIC 3241581 (S /N {$\sim$} 170). For this star, the fundamental spectral parameters are extracted using a differential analysis. Sufficient S/N in the near ultraviolet allows us to investigate the chromospheric magnetic activity in both objects.
Results. We constructed three solar spectrum atlases from 385 to 900 nm, obtained with the HERMES spectrograph from observations of two bright asteroids and a jovian moon. A comparison between our solar spectra atlas to the Kurucz and HARPS solar spectrum shows an excellent agreement. KIC 3241581 was found to be a long-periodic binary system. The fundamental parameter for the stellar primary component are Teff = 5689 {$\pm$} 11 K, log g = 4.385 {$\pm$} 0.005, [Fe/H] = +0.22 {$\pm$} 0.01, being in agreement with the published global seismic values, which confirms its status as solar analogue. The chromospheric activity level is compatible with the solar magnetic activity observed during 2014 and 2015.
Conclusions. Our solar atlas is an essential tool for the analysis of solar-like stars and to characterise solar analogues and twins with HERMES. The differential analysis, using the presented solar atlas from HERMES observations allows us to obtain the fundamental parameters with very high accuracy. KIC 3241581 is a metal-rich solar analogue with a solar-like activity level in a binary system of unknown period.},

  shorttitle = {Lithium Abundance and Rotation of Seismic Solar Analogues},
  abstract = {Methods. We selected a sample of 18 solar-analogue stars observed by the NASA Kepler satellite for an in-depth analysis. Their seismic properties and surface rotation rates are well constrained from previous studies. About 53 h of high-resolution spectroscopy were obtained to derive fundamental parameters from spectroscopy and A(Li). These values were combined and compared with seismic masses, radii, and ages, as well as with surface rotation periods measured from Kepler photometry.
Results. Based on radial velocities, we identify and confirm a total of six binary star systems. For each star, a signal-to-noise ratio of 80 S /N 210 was typically achieved in the final spectrum around the lithium line. We report fundamental parameters and A(Li). Using the surface rotation period derived from Kepler photometry, we obtained a well-defined relation between A(Li) and rotation. The seismic radius translates the surface rotation period into surface velocity. With models constrained by the characterisation of the individual mode frequencies for single stars, we identify a sequence of three solar analogues with similar mass ({$\sim$}1.1 M ) and stellar ages ranging between 1 to 9 Gyr. Within the realistic estimate of {$\sim$}7\% for the mass uncertainty, we find a good agreement between the measured A(Li) and the predicted A(Li) evolution from a grid of models calculated with the Toulouse-Geneva stellar evolution code, which includes rotational internal mixing, calibrated to reproduce solar chemical properties. We found a scatter in ages inferred from the global seismic parameters that is too large when compared with A(Li).
Conclusions. We present the Li-abundance for a consistent spectroscopic survey of solar-analogue stars with a mass of 1.00 {$\pm$} 0.15 M that are characterised through asteroseismology and surface rotation rates based on Kepler observations. The correlation between A(Li) and Prot supports the gyrochronological concept for stars younger than the Sun and becomes clearer when the confirmed binaries are excluded. The consensus between measured A(Li) for solar analogues with model grids, calibrated on the Sun's chemical properties, suggests that these targets share the same internal physics. In this light, the solar Li and rotation rate appear to be normal for a star like the Sun.},

  shorttitle = {Seismic Probing of the First Dredge-up Event through the Eccentric Red-Giant and Red-Giant Spectroscopic Binary {{KIC}} 9163796},
  abstract = {Methods. We analysed four years of Kepler space photometry and we obtained high-resolution spectroscopy with the Hermes instrument. The orbital elements and the spectra of both components were determined using spectral disentangling methods. The effective temperatures, and metallicities were extracted from disentangled spectra of the two stars. Mass and radius of the primary were determined through asteroseismology. The surface rotation period of the primary is determined from the Kepler light curve. From representative theoretical models of the star, we derived the internal rotational gradient, while for a grid of models, the measured lithium abundance is compared with theoretical predictions.
Results. From seismology the primary of KIC 9163796 is a star of 1.39 {$\pm$} 0.06 M , while the spectroscopic mass ratio between both components can be determined with much higher precision by spectral disentangling to be 1.015 {$\pm$} 0.005. With such mass and a difference in effective temperature of 600 K from spectroscopy, the secondary and primary are, respectively, in the early and advanced stage of the first dredge-up event on the red-giant branch. The period of the primary's surface rotation resembles the orbital period within ten days. The radial rotational gradient between the surface and core in KIC 9163796 is found to be 6.9+-21..00. This is a low value but not exceptional if compared to the sample of typical single field stars. The seismic average of the envelope's rotation agrees with the surface rotation rate. The lithium'abundance is in agreement with quasi rigidly rotating models.
Conclusions. The agreement between the surface rotation with the seismic result indicates that the full convective envelope is rotating quasi-rigidly. The models of the lithium abundance are compatible with a rigid rotation in the radiative zone during the main sequence. Because of the many constraints offered by oscillating stars in binary systems, such objects are important test beds of stellar evolution.},

  title = {Testing Tidal Theory for Evolved Stars by Using Red-Giant Binaries Observed by {{Kepler}}},
  issn = {1745-3925, 1745-3933},
  abstract = {Tidal interaction governs the redistribution of angular momentum in close binary stars and planetary systems and determines the systems evolution towards the possible equilibrium state. Turbulent friction acting on the equilibrium tide in the convective envelope of low-mass stars is known to have a strong impact on this exchange of angular momentum in binaries. Moreover, theoretical modelling in recent literature as well as presented in this paper suggests that the dissipation of the dynamical tide, constituted of tidal inertial waves propagating in the convective envelope, is weak compared to the dissipation of the equilibrium tide during the red giant phase. This prediction is confirmed when we apply the equilibrium-tide formalism developed by Zahn, Verbunt \& Phinney, and Remus, Mathis \& Zahn on to the sample of all known red giant binaries observed by the NASA Kepler mission. Moreover, the observations are adequately explained by only invoking the equilibrium tide dissipation. Such ensemble analysis also benefits from the seismic characterization of the oscillating components and surface rotation rates. Through asteroseismology, previous claims of the eccentricity as an evolutionary state diagnostic are discarded. This result is important for our understanding of the evolution of multiple star and planetary systems during advanced stages of stellar evolution.},

  abstract = {Detecting the presence and characteristic scale of a signal is a common problem in data analysis. We develop a fast statistical test of the null hypothesis that a Fourier-like power spectrum is consistent with noise. The null hypothesis is rejected where the local `coefficient of variation' (CV) \textendash{} the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean \textendash{} in a power spectrum deviates significantly from expectations for pure noise (CV {$\approx$} 1.0 for a {$\chi$} 2 2-degrees-offreedom distribution). This technique is of particular utility for detecting signals in power spectra with frequency-dependent noise backgrounds, as it is only sensitive to features that are sharp relative to the inspected frequency bin width. We develop a CV-based algorithm to quickly detect the presence of solar-like oscillations in photometric power spectra that are dominated by stellar granulation. This approach circumvents the need for background fitting to measure the frequency of maximum solar-like oscillation power, {$\nu$}max. In this paper, we derive the basic method and demonstrate its ability to detect the pulsational power excesses from the well-studied APOKASC-2 sample of oscillating red giants observed by Kepler. We recover the catalogued {$\nu$}max values with an average precision of 2.7 per cent for 99.4 per cent of the stars with 4 yr of Kepler photometry. Our method produces false positives for {$<$} 1 per cent of dwarf stars with {$\nu$}max well above the long-cadence Nyquist frequency. The algorithm also flags spectra that exhibit astrophysically interesting signals in addition to single solar-like oscillation power excesses, which we catalogue as part of our characterization of the Kepler light curves of APOKASC-2 targets.},

Nine of these stars had incorrect or unknown periods in the literature. 14 of the stars exhibit both amplitude and phase Blazhko modulations, with Blazhko periods ranging from 27.7 to more than 200 d. For V445 Lyr, a longer secondary variation is also observed in addition to its 53.2-d Blazhko period. The unprecedented precision of the Kepler photometry has led to the discovery of the the smallest modulations detected so far. Moreover, additional frequencies beyond the well-known harmonics and Blazhko multiplets have been found. These frequencies are located around the half-integer multiples of the main pulsation frequency for at least three stars. In four stars, these frequencies are close to the first and/or second overtone modes. The amplitudes of these periodicities seem to vary over the Blazhko cycle. V350 Lyr, a non-Blazhko star in our sample, is the first example of a double-mode RR Lyrae star that pulsates in its fundamental and second overtone modes.},

It allows stringent tests of stellar models and can provide accurate radii, masses, and ages for individual stars. Of particular interest are the mixed modes that occur in subgiant solar-like stars since they can place very strong constraints on stellar ages. Here, we measure the characteristics of the mixed modes, particularly the coupling strength, using a grid of stellar models for stars with masses between 0.9 and 1.5 M . We show that the coupling strength of the = 1 mixed modes is predominantly a function of stellar mass and appears to be independent of metallicity. This should allow an accurate mass evaluation, further increasing the usefulness of mixed modes in subgiants as asteroseismic tools.},

  abstract = {We develop a detailed methodology of determining three-dimensionally the angle between the stellar spin and the planetary orbit axis vectors, {$\psi$}, for transiting planetary systems. The determination of {$\psi$} requires the independent estimates of the inclination angles of the stellar spin axis and of the planetary orbital axis with respect to the line of sight, i and iorb, and the projection of the spin\textendash{}orbit angle on to the plane of the sky, {$\lambda$}. These are mainly derived from asteroseismology, transit lightcurve, and the Rossiter\textendash{}McLaughlin effect, respectively. The detailed joint analysis of those three datasets enables an accurate and precise determination of the numerous parameters characterizing the planetary system, in addition to {$\psi$}. We demonstrate the power of the joint analysis for the two specific systems HAT-P-7 and Kepler-25. HAT-P-7b is the first exoplanet suspected to be a retrograde (or polar) planet because of the significant misalignment {$\lambda$} {$\approx$} 180{$\smwhtcircle$}. Our joint analysis indicates i {$\approx$} 30{$\smwhtcircle$} and {$\psi$} {$\approx$} 120{$\smwhtcircle$}, suggesting that the planetary orbit is closer to polar rather than retrograde. Kepler-25 is one of the few multi-transiting planetary systems with measured {$\lambda$}, and hosts two short-period transiting planets and one outer non-transiting planet. The projected spin\textendash{}orbit angle of the larger transiting planet, Kepler-25c, has been measured to be {$\lambda$} {$\approx$} 0{$\smwhtcircle$}, implying that the system is well aligned. With the help of the tight constraint from asteroseismology, however, we obtain i = 65{$\smwhtcircle$}.4+-160{$\smwhtcircle$}. 4{$\smwhtcircle$}. 6 and {$\psi$} = 26{$\smwhtcircle$}. 9+-79 {$\smwhtcircle$}.},

It is found that the difference between the surface rotation rate and the average rotation rate (excluding the convective core) of most of stars is small enough to suggest that an efficient process of angular momentum transport operates during and/or before the main-sequence stage of stars. If each of the surface convective zone and the underlying radiative zone, for individual stars, is assumed to rotate uniformly, the difference in the rotation rate between the two zones turns out to be no more than a factor of 2 in most of the stars independently of their ages.},

  abstract = {Oscillation properties are usually measured by fitting symmetric Lorentzian profiles to the power spectra of Sunlike stars. However, the line profiles of solar oscillations have been observed to be asymmetrical for the Sun. The physical origin of this line asymmetry is not fully understood; though, it should depend on the depth dependence of the source of wave excitation (convective turbulence) and details of the observable (velocity or intensity). For oscillations of the Sun, it has been shown that neglecting the asymmetry leads to systematic errors in the frequency determination. This could subsequently affect the results of seismic inferences of the solar internal structure. Using light curves from the Kepler spacecraft, we have measured mode asymmetries in 43 stars. We confirm that neglecting the asymmetry leads to systematic errors that can exceed the 1{$\sigma$} confidence intervals for seismic observations longer than one year. Therefore, the application of an asymmetric Lorentzian profile should be favored to improve the accuracy of the internal stellar structure and stellar fundamental parameters. We also show that the asymmetry changes sign between cool Sun-like stars and hotter stars. This provides the best constraints to date on the location of the excitation sources across the Hertzsprung\textendash{}Russel diagram.},

We find that {$\approx$}67\% ({$\approx$}120,000) of all Kepler targets are main-sequence stars, {$\approx$}21\% ({$\approx$}37,000) are subgiants, and {$\approx$}12\% ({$\approx$}21,000) are red giants, demonstrating that subgiant contamination is less severe than some previous estimates and that Kepler targets are mostly main-sequence stars. Using the revised stellar radii, we recalculate the radii for 2123 confirmed and 1922 candidate exoplanets. We confirm the presence of a gap in the radius distribution of small, close-in planets, but find that the gap is mostly limited to incident fluxes {$>$}200 F{\AA}, and its location may be at a slightly larger radius (closer to {$\approx$}2 R{$\oplus$}) when compared to previous results. Furthermore, we find several confirmed exoplanets occupying a previously described ``hot super-Earth desert'' at high irradiance, show the relation between a gas-giant planet's radius and its incident flux, and establish a bona fide sample of eight confirmed planets and 30 planet candidates with Rp {$<$} 2 R{$\oplus$} in circumstellar ``habitable zones'' (incident fluxes between 0.25 and 1.50 F{\AA}). The results presented here demonstrate the potential for transformative characterization of stellar and exoplanet populations using Gaia data.},

Importantly, both of the giants have been classified as core He-burning red clump (RC) stars based on asteroseismic data from Kepler mission. Also, both of the stars are found to be low mass (M {$\approx$} 1.0 Me), which, together with an evidence of their evolutionary status of being RC stars, implies that the stars have gone through both the luminosity bump and He-flash during their red giant branch (RGB) evolution. The stars' large Li abundance and evolutionary phase suggest that Li enrichment occurred very recently, probably at the tip of the RGB either during He-flash, an immediate preceding event on the RGB, or by some kind of external event such as merger of an RGB star with white dwarf. The findings will provide critical constraints to theoretical models for understanding of Li enhancement origin in RGB stars.},

  abstract = {The Kepler Mission has acquired 33.5 d of continuous 1-min photometry of KPD 1946+4340, a short-period binary system that consists of a subdwarf B star (sdB) and a white dwarf. In the light curve, eclipses are clearly seen, with the deepest occurring when the compact white dwarf crosses the disc of the sdB (0.4 per cent) and the more shallow ones (0.1 per cent) when the sdB eclipses the white dwarf. As expected, the sdB is deformed by the gravitational field of the white dwarf, which produces an ellipsoidal modulation of the light curve. Spectacularly, a very strong Doppler beaming (also known as Doppler boosting) effect is also clearly evident at the 0.1 per cent level. This originates from the sdB's orbital velocity, which we measure to be 164.0 {$\pm$} 1.9 km s-1 from supporting spectroscopy. We present light-curve models that account for all these effects, as well as gravitational lensing, which decreases the apparent radius of the white dwarf by about 6 per cent, when it eclipses the sdB. We derive system parameters and uncertainties from the light curve using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. Adopting a theoretical white dwarf mass\textendash{}radius relation, the mass of the subdwarf is found to be 0.47 {$\pm$} 0.03 M and the mass of the white dwarf 0.59 {$\pm$} 0.02 M . The effective temperature of the white dwarf is 15 900 {$\pm$} 300 K. With a spectroscopic effective temperature of Teff = 34 730 {$\pm$} 250 K and a surface gravity of log g = 5.43 {$\pm$} 0.04, the subdwarf has most likely exhausted its core helium, and is in a shell He burning stage.},

  abstract = {Stellar models generally use simple parameterizations to treat convection. The most widely used parameterization is the so-called mixing-length theory where the convective eddy sizes are described using a single number, {$\alpha$}, the mixing-length parameter. This is a free parameter, and the general practice is to calibrate {$\alpha$} using the known properties of the Sun and apply that to all stars. Using data from NASA's Kepler mission we show that using the solar-calibrated {$\alpha$} is not always appropriate, and that in many cases it would lead to estimates of initial helium abundances that are lower than the primordial helium abundance. Kepler data allow us to calibrate {$\alpha$} for many other stars and we show that for the sample of stars we have studied, the mixing-length parameter is generally lower than the solar value. We studied the correlation between {$\alpha$} and stellar properties, and we find that {$\alpha$} increases with metallicity. We therefore conclude that results obtained by fitting stellar models or by using population-synthesis models constructed with solar values of {$\alpha$} are likely to have large systematic errors. Our results also confirm theoretical expectations that the mixing-length parameter should vary with stellar properties.},

Results. We demonstrate the presence of a clear correlation between the Mt. Wilson S index and the relative age of the stars as indicated by the small frequency separation, as well as an anti-correlation between the S index and the oscillation amplitudes. We argue that the average activity level of the stars shows a stronger correlation with the small frequency separation than with the absolute age that is often considered in the literature.
Conclusions. The phenomenological laws discovered in this paper have the potential to become new important diagnostics to link stellar evolution theory with the dynamics of global magnetic fields. In particular we argue that the relation between the Mt. Wilson S index and the oscillation amplitudes is in good agreement with the findings of direct numerical simulations of magneto-convection.},

It has been continuously observed for more than 2 yr with the Kepler space telescope. Of the nine quarters of the data, three have been obtained in short-cadence mode, that is one point per 58.9 s. Here we analyse this unique data set to determine absolute physical parameters (most importantly the masses and radii) and full orbital configuration using a sophisticated novel approach. We measure eclipse timing variations (ETVs), which are then combined with the single-lined radial velocity measurements to yield masses in a manner equivalent to double-lined spectroscopic binaries. We have also developed a new light-curve synthesis code that is used to model the triple, mutual eclipses and the effects of the changing tidal field on the stellar surface and the relativistic Doppler beaming. By combining the stellar masses from the ETV study with the simultaneous light-curve analysis we determine the absolute radii of the three stars. Our results indicate that the close and the wide subsystems revolve in almost exactly coplanar and prograde orbits. The newly determined parameters draw a consistent picture of the system with such details that have been beyond reach before.},

The planet has an orbital period of 3.213 days and shows transits with a relative depth of 0.87 \texttimes{} 10-3 and a duration of about 3.95 hr. Radial velocity (RV) measurements from the Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer show a reflex Doppler signal of 9.3+-11..19 m s-1, consistent with a low-eccentricity orbit with the phase expected from the transits. Various tests show no evidence for any companion star near enough to affect the light curve or the RVs for this system. From a transit-based estimate of the host star's mean density, combined with analysis of high-resolution spectra, we infer that the host star is near turnoff from the main sequence, with estimated mass and radius of 1.223+-00..005931 M and 1.487+-00..007814 R .

The precise asteroseismic measurements of gravity-mode period spacing ( 1) have opened the door to detailed studies of the near-core structure of such stars, which had not been possible before. Here, we provide stringent tests of various core-mixing scenarios against the largely unbiased population of red-clump stars belonging to the old-open clusters monitored by Kepler, and by coupling the updated precise inference on 1 in thousands of field stars with spectroscopic constraints. We find that models with moderate overshooting successfully reproduce the range observed of 1 in clusters. In particular, we show that there is no evidence for the need to extend the size of the adiabatically stratified core, at least at the beginning of the HeCB phase. This conclusion is based primarily on ensemble studies of 1 as a function of mass and metallicity. While 1 shows no appreciable dependence on the mass, we have found a clear dependence of 1 on metallicity, which is also supported by predictions from models.},

  abstract = {We present the results of a search for amplitude modulation of pulsation modes in 983 {$\delta$} Sct stars, which have effective temperatures between 6400 {$\leq$} Teff {$\leq$} 10 000 K in the Kepler Input Catalogue and were continuously observed by the Kepler Space Telescope for 4 yr. We demonstrate the diversity in pulsational behaviour observed, in particular non-linearity, which is predicted for {$\delta$} Sct stars. We analyse and discuss examples of {$\delta$} Sct stars with constant amplitudes and phases; those that exhibit amplitude modulation caused by beating of closefrequency pulsation modes; those that exhibit pure amplitude modulation (with no associated phase variation); those that exhibit phase modulation caused by binarity; and those that exhibit amplitude modulation caused by non-linearity. Using models and examples of individual stars, we demonstrate that observations of the changes in amplitude and phase of pulsation modes can be used to distinguish among the different scenarios. We find that 603 {$\delta$} Sct stars (61.3 per cent) exhibit at least one pulsation mode that varies significantly in amplitude over 4 yr. Conversely, many {$\delta$} Sct stars have constant pulsation amplitudes so short-length observations can be used to determine precise frequencies, amplitudes and phases for the most coherent and periodic {$\delta$} Sct stars. It is shown that amplitude modulation is not restricted to a small region on the HR diagram, therefore not necessarily dependent on stellar parameters such as Teff or log g. Our catalogue of 983 {$\delta$} Sct stars will be useful for comparisons to similar stars observed by K2 and TESS, because the length of the 4-yr Kepler data set will not be surpassed for some time.},

The Kepler data set was divided into a series with time bins of equal length for which consecutive Fourier transforms were calculated. An optimum fixed frequency, calculated from a least-squares fit of all data, allowed amplitude and phase of each pulsation mode for each time bin to be tracked. The single pressure mode at {$\nu$} = 13.3942 d-1 changed significantly in amplitude, from 5.16 {$\pm$} 0.03 to 0.53 {$\pm$} 0.06 mmag, but also varied quasi-sinusoidally in phase, with a characteristic period similar to the length of the data set. All other p and g modes were stable in both amplitude and phase, which is clear evidence that the visible pulsation mode energy is not conserved within this star. Possible causes of the observed amplitude and phase modulation and the missing mode energy are discussed.},

  volume = {476},
  issn = {0035-8711, 1365-2966},
  abstract = {The {$\delta$} Sct stars are a diverse group of intermediate-mass pulsating stars located on and near the main sequence within the classical instability strip in the Hertzsprung\textendash{}Russell diagram. Many of these stars are hybrid stars pulsating simultaneously with pressure and gravity modes that probe the physics at different depths within a star's interior. Using two large ensembles of {$\delta$} Sct stars observed by the Kepler Space Telescope, the instrumental biases inherent to Kepler mission data and the statistical properties of these stars are investigated. An important focus of this work is an analysis of the relationships between the pulsational and stellar parameters, and their distribution within the classical instability strip. It is found that a non-negligible fraction of main-sequence {$\delta$} Sct stars exist outside theoretical predictions of the classical instability boundaries, which indicates the necessity of a mass-dependent mixing length parameter to simultaneously explain low and high radial order pressure modes in {$\delta$} Sct stars within the Hertzsprung\textendash{}Russell diagram. Furthermore, a search for regularities in the amplitude spectra of these stars is also presented, specifically the frequency difference between pressure modes of consecutive radial order. In this work, it is demonstrated that an ensemble-based approach using space photometry from the Kepler mission is not only plausible for {$\delta$} Sct stars, but that it is a valuable method for identifying the most promising stars for mode identification and asteroseismic modelling. The full scientific potential of studying {$\delta$} Sct stars is as yet unrealized. The ensembles discussed in this paper represent a high-quality data set for future studies of rotation and angular momentum transport inside A and F stars using asteroseismology.},

  abstract = {Over the duration of the Kepler mission, KIC 8462852 was observed to undergo irregularly shaped, aperiodic dips in flux of up to {$\sim$}20 per cent. The dipping activity can last for between 5 and 80 d. We characterize the object with high-resolution spectroscopy, spectral energy distribution fitting, radial velocity measurements, high-resolution imaging, and Fourier analyses of the Kepler light curve. We determine that KIC 8462852 is a typical main-sequence F3 V star that exhibits no significant IR excess, and has no very close interacting companions. In this paper, we describe various scenarios to explain the dipping events observed in the Kepler light curve. We confirm that the dipping signals in the data are not caused by any instrumental or data processing artefact, and thus are astrophysical in origin. We construct scenario-independent constraints on the size and location of a body in the system that are needed to reproduce the observations. We deliberate over several assorted stellar and circumstellar astrophysical scenarios, most of which have problems explaining the data in hand. By considering the observational constraints on dust clumps in orbit around a normal main-sequence star, we conclude that the scenario most consistent with the data in hand is the passage of a family of exocomet or planetesimal fragments, all of which are associated with a single previous break-up event, possibly caused by tidal disruption or thermal processing. The minimum total mass associated with these fragments likely exceeds 10-6 M{$\oplus$}, corresponding to an original rocky body of {$>$}100 km in diameter. We discuss the necessity of future observations to help interpret the system.},

The light curves were analyzed in a uniform manner to search for {$\gamma$} Dor, {$\delta$} Sct, and hybrid star pulsations. The {$\gamma$} Dor, {$\delta$} Sct, and hybrid star pulsations extend asteroseismology to stars slightly more massive (1.4\textendash{}2.5 Me) than our Sun. We find 207 {$\gamma$} Dor, 84 {$\delta$} Sct, and 32 hybrid candidate stars. Many of these stars are cooler than the red edge of the {$\gamma$} Dor instability strip as determined from ground-based observations made before Kepler. A few of our {$\gamma$} Dor candidate stars lie on the hot side of the ground-based {$\gamma$} Dor instability strip. The hybrid candidate stars cover the entire region between 6200 K and the blue edge of the ground-based {$\delta$} Sct instability strip. None of our candidate stars are hotter than the hot edge of the ground-based {$\delta$} Sct instability strip. Our discoveries, coupled with the work of others, show that Kepler has discovered over 2000 {$\gamma$} Dor, {$\delta$} Sct, and hybrid star candidates in the 116 square degree Kepler field of view. We found relatively few variable stars fainter than magnitude 15, which may be because they are far enough away to lie between spiral arms in our Galaxy, where there would be fewer stars.},

  abstract = {In the faint star KIC 9700322 observed by the Kepler satellite, 76 frequencies with amplitudes from 14 to 29 000 ppm were detected. The two dominant frequencies at 9.79 and 12.57 d-1 (113.3 and 145.5 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz), interpreted to be radial modes, are accompanied by a large number of combination frequencies. A small additional modulation with a 0.16 d-1 frequency is also seen; this is interpreted to be the rotation frequency of the star. The corresponding prediction of slow rotation is confirmed by a spectrum from which v sin i = 19 {$\pm$} 1 km s-1 is obtained. The analysis of the spectrum shows that the star is one of the coolest {$\delta$} Sct variables. We also determine Teff = 6700 {$\pm$} 100 K and log g = 3.7 {$\pm$} 0.1, compatible with the observed frequencies of the radial modes. Normal solar abundances are found. An = 2 frequency quintuplet is also detected with a frequency separation consistent with predictions from the measured rotation rate. A remarkable result is the absence of additional independent frequencies down to an amplitude limit near 14 ppm, suggesting that the star is stable against most forms of non-radial pulsation. A low-frequency peak at 2.7763 d-1 in KIC 9700322 is the frequency difference between the two dominant modes and is repeated over and over in various frequency combinations involving the two dominant modes. The relative phases of the combination frequencies show a strong correlation with frequency, but the physical significance of this result is not clear.},

  abstract = {Two years of Kepler data of KIC 8054146 ({$\delta$} Sct/{$\gamma$} Dor hybrid) revealed 349 statistically significant frequencies between 0.54 and 191.36 cycles day-1 (6.3 {$\mu$}Hz to 2.21 mHz). The 117 low frequencies cluster in specific frequency bands, but do not show the equidistant period spacings predicted for gravity modes of successive radial order, n, and reported for at least one other hybrid pulsator. The four dominant low frequencies in the 2.8\textendash{}3.0 cycles day-1 (32\textendash{}35 {$\mu$}Hz) range show strong amplitude variability with timescales of months and years. These four low frequencies also determine the spacing of the higher frequencies in and beyond the {$\delta$} Sct pressuremode frequency domain. In fact, most of the higher frequencies belong to one of three families with spacings linked to a specific dominant low frequency. In the Fourier spectrum, these family regularities show up as triplets, high-frequency sequences with absolutely equidistant frequency spacings, side lobes (amplitude modulations), and other regularities in frequency spacings. Furthermore, within two families the amplitude variations between the low and high frequencies are related. We conclude that the low frequencies (gravity modes, rotation) and observed high frequencies (mostly pressure modes) are physically connected. This unusual behavior may be related to the very rapid rotation of the star: from a combination of high- and low-resolution spectroscopy we determined that KIC 8054146 is a very fast rotator ({$\upsilon$} sin i = 300 {$\pm$} 20 km s-1) with an effective temperature of 7600 {$\pm$} 200 K and a surface gravity log g of 3.9 {$\pm$} 0.3. Several astrophysical ideas explaining the origin of the relationship between the low and high frequencies are explored.},

  abstract = {We have analyzed the theoretical model envelopes of eight Kepler F-stars by computing the phase shift of the acoustic waves, a(w), and its related function, b (w). The latter is shown to be a powerful probe of the external stellar layers since it is particularly sensitive to the partial ionization zones located in these upper layers. We found that these theoretical envelopes can be organized into two groups, each of which is characterized by a distinct b (w) shape that we show to reflect the differences related to the magnitudes of ionization processes. Since b (w) can also be determined from the experimental frequencies, we compared our theoretical results with the observable b (w). Using the function b (w), and with the purpose of quantifying the magnitude of the ionization processes occurring in the outer layers of these stars, we define two indexes, Db1 and Db2. These indexes allow us to connect the microphysics of the interior of the star with macroscopic observable characteristics. Motivated by the distinct magnetic activity behaviors of F-stars, we studied the relation between the star's rotation period and these indexes. We found a trend, in the form of a power-law dependence, that favors the idea that ionization is acting as an underlying mechanism, which is crucial for understanding the relation between rotation and magnetism and even observational features such as the Kraft break.},

This can be achieved by measuring independent, accurate, and precise masses, radii, effective temperatures and metallicities of long period eclipsing binary stars with a red giant component that displays solar-like oscillations. We measured precise properties of the three eclipsing binary systems KIC 7037405, KIC 9540226, and KIC 9970396 and estimated their ages be 5.3 {$\pm$} 0.5, 3.1 {$\pm$} 0.6, and 4.8 {$\pm$} 0.5 Gyr. The measurements of the giant stars were compared to corresponding measurements of mass, radius, and age using asteroseismic scaling relations and grid modelling. We found that asteroseismic scaling relations without corrections to {$\nu$} systematically overestimate the masses of the three red giants by 11.7 per cent, 13.7 per cent, and 18.9 per cent, respectively. However, by applying theoretical correction factors f {$\nu$} according to Rodrigues et al. (2017), we reached general agreement between dynamical and asteroseismic mass estimates, and no indications of systematic differences at the precision level of the asteroseismic measurements. The larger sample investigated by Gaulme et al. (2016) showed a much more complicated situation, where some stars show agreement between the dynamical and corrected asteroseismic measures while others suggest significant overestimates of the asteroseismic measures. We found no simple explanation for this, but indications of several potential problems, some theoretical, others observational. Therefore, an extension of the present precision study to a larger sample of eclipsing systems is crucial for establishing and improving the accuracy of asteroseismology of giant stars.},

  abstract = {Regions of rapid variation in the internal structure of a star are often referred to as acoustic glitches since they create a characteristic periodic signature in the frequencies of p modes. Here we examine the localized disturbance arising from the helium second ionization zone in red giant branch and clump stars. More specifically, we determine how accurately and precisely the parameters of the ionization zone can be obtained from the oscillation frequencies of stellar models. We use models produced by three different generation codes that not only cover a wide range of stages of evolution along the red giant phase but also incorporate different initial helium abundances. To study the acoustic glitch caused by the second ionization zone of helium we have determined the second differences in frequencies of modes with the same angular degree, l, and then we fit the periodic function described by Houdek \& Gough to the second differences. We discuss the conditions under which such fits robustly and accurately determine the acoustic radius of the second ionization zone of helium. When the frequency of maximum amplitude of the p-mode oscillations was greater than 40 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz a robust value for the radius of the ionization zone was recovered for the majority of models. The determined radii of the ionization zones as inferred from the mode frequencies were found to be coincident with the local maximum in the first adiabatic exponent described by the models, which is associated with the outer edge of the second ionization zone of helium. Finally, we consider whether this method can be used to distinguish stars with different helium abundances. Although a definite trend in the amplitude of the signal is observed any distinction would be difficult unless the stars come from populations with vastly different helium abundances or the uncertainties associated with the fitted parameters can be reduced. However, application of our methodology could be useful for distinguishing between different populations of red giant stars in globular clusters, where distinct populations with very different helium abundances have been observed.},

  abstract = {We describe the photometric calibration and stellar classification methods used by the Stellar Classification Project to produce the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). The KIC is a catalog containing photometric and physical data for sources in the Kepler mission field of view; it is used by the mission to select optimal targets. Four of the visible-light (g, r, i, z) magnitudes used in the KIC are tied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey magnitudes; the fifth (D51) is an AB magnitude calibrated to be consistent with Castelli \& Kurucz (CK) model atmosphere fluxes. We derived atmospheric extinction corrections from hourly observations of secondary standard fields within the Kepler field of view. For these filters and extinction estimates, repeatability of absolute photometry for stars brighter than magnitude 15 is typically 2\%. We estimated stellar parameters \{Teff, log(g), log(Z), EB-V \} using Bayesian posterior probability maximization to match observed colors to CK stellar atmosphere models. We applied Bayesian priors describing the distribution of solar-neighborhood stars in the color\textendash{}magnitude diagram, in log(Z), and in height above the galactic plane. Several comparisons with samples of stars classified by other means indicate that for 4500 K Teff 6500 K, our classifications are reliable within about {$\pm$}200 K and 0.4 dex in log(g) for dwarfs, with somewhat larger log(g) uncertainties for giants. It is difficult to assess the reliability of our log(Z) estimates, but there is reason to suspect that it is poor, particularly at extreme Teff. Comparisons between the CK models and observed colors are generally satisfactory with some exceptions, notably for stars cooler than 4500 K. Of great importance for the Kepler mission, for Teff 5400 K, comparison with asteroseismic results shows that the distinction between main-sequence stars and giants is reliable with about 98\% confidence. Larger errors in log(g) occur for warmer stars, for which our filter set provides inadequate gravity diagnostics. The KIC is available through the MAST data archive.},

We applied the iterative spectral synthesis method VWA to derive the fundamental parameters from carefully selected high-quality iron lines and pressure-sensitive Calcium lines.
Results. We find good agreement with parameters from the literature for the six bright giants. We compared the spectroscopic values with parameters based on photometric indices in the Kepler Input Catalogue (KIC). We identify serious problems with the KIC values for [Fe/H] and find a large RMS scatter of 0.5 dex. The log g values in KIC agree reasonably well with the spectroscopic values displaying a scatter of 0.25 dex after excluding two low-metallicity giants. The Teff values from VWA and KIC agree well with a scatter of about 85 K. We also find good agreement with log g and Teff derived from asteroseismic analyses for seven Kepler giant targets.
Conclusions. We determine accurate fundamental parameters of 14 giants using spectroscopic data. The large discrepancies between photometric and spectroscopic values of [Fe/H] emphasize the need for further detailed spectroscopic follow-up of the Kepler targets. This will be mandatory to be able to produce reliable constraints for detailed asteroseismic analyses and interpretation of possible exo-planet candidates found around giant stars.},

  abstract = {Asteroseismology provides global stellar parameters such as masses, radii or surface gravities using the mean global seismic parameters as well as the effective temperature for thousands of low-mass stars (0.8M {$<$} M {$<$} 3M ). This methodology has been successfully applied to stars in which acoustic modes excited by turbulent convection are measured. Other techniques such as the Flicker can also be used to determine stellar surface gravities, but only works for log g above 2.5 dex. In this work, we present a new metric called FliPer (the acronym stands for Flicker in spectral power density, in opposition to the standard Flicker measurement which is computed in the time domain) that is able to extend the range for which reliable surface gravities can be obtained (0.1 {$<$} log g {$<$} 4.6 dex) without performing any seismic analysis for stars brighter than Kp {$<$} 14. FliPer takes into account the average variability of a star measured in the power density spectrum in a given range of frequencies. However, FliPer values calculated on several ranges of frequency are required to better characterize a star. Using a large set of asteroseismic targets it is possible to calibrate the behavior of surface gravity with FliPer through machine learning. This calibration made with a random forest regressor covers a wide range of surface gravities from main-sequence stars to subgiants and red giants, with very small uncertainties from 0.04 to 0.1 dex. FliPer values can be inserted in automatic global seismic pipelines to either give an estimation of the stellar surface gravity or to assess the quality of the seismic results by detecting any outliers in the obtained {$\nu$}max values. FliPer also constrain the surface gravities of main-sequence dwarfs using only long cadence data for which the Nyquist frequency is too low to measure the acoustic-mode properties.},

  abstract = {Since the CoRoT and Kepler missions, the availability of high quality seismic spectra for red giants has made them the standard clocks and rulers for Galactic Archeology. With the expected excellent data from the TESS and PLATO missions, red giants will again play a key role in Galactic studies and stellar physics, thanks to the precise masses and radii determined by asteroseismology. The determination of these quantities is often based on so-called scaling laws, which have been used extensively for main-sequence stars. We show how the SOLA inversion technique can provide robust determinations of the mean density of red giants within 1 per cent of the real value, using only radial oscillations. Combined with radii determinations from Gaia of around 2 per cent precision, this approach provides robust, less model-dependent masses with an error lower than 10 per cent. It will improve age determinations, helping to accurately dissect the Galactic structure and history. We present results on artificial data of standard models, models including an extended atmosphere from averaged 3D simulations and non-adiabatic frequency calculations to test surface effects, and on eclipsing binaries. We show that the inversions provide very robust mean density estimates, using at best seismic information. However, we also show that a distinction between red-giant branch and red-clump stars is required to determine a reliable estimate of the mean density. The stability of the inversion enables an implementation in automated pipelines, making it suitable for large samples of stars.},

  abstract = {Methods. We developed a data-driven method to perform frequency extraction and mode identification. Next, we used the identified dipole mixed modes to determine the gravity-mode period spacing by means of an empirical method and by means of the asymptotic relation. In our methodology we consider the phase offset, g, of the asymptotic relation as a free parameter.
Results. Using the frequencies of the identified dipole mixed modes for each star in the sample, we derived a value for the gravitymode period spacing using the two different methods. These values differ by less than 5\%. The average precision we achieved for the period spacing derived from the asymptotic relation is better than 1\%, while that of our data-driven approach is 3\%.
Conclusions. Good agreement is found between values for the period spacing derived from the asymptotic relation and from the empirical method. The achieved uncertainties are small, but do not support the ultra-high precision claimed in the literature. The precision from our data-driven method is mostly affected by the differing number of observed dipole mixed modes. For the asymptotic relation, the phase offset, g, remains ill defined, but enables a more robust analysis of both the asymptotic period spacing and the dimensionless coupling factor. However, its estimation might still offer a valuable observational diagnostic for future theoretical modeling.},

  abstract = {The chemical composition of stars hosting small exoplanets (with radii less than four Earth radii) appears to be more diverse than that of gas-giant hosts, which tend to be metal-rich. This implies that small, including Earth-size, planets may have readily formed at earlier epochs in the universe's history when metals were more scarce. We report Kepler spacecraft observations of Kepler-444, a metal-poor Sun-like star from the old population of the Galactic thick disk and the host to a compact system of five transiting planets with sizes between those of Mercury and Venus. We validate this system as a true five-planet system orbiting the target star and provide a detailed characterization of its planetary and orbital parameters based on an analysis of the transit photometry. Kepler-444 is the densest star with detected solar-like oscillations. We use asteroseismology to directly measure a precise age of 11.2 {$\pm$} 1.0 Gyr for the host star, indicating that Kepler-444 formed when the universe was less than 20\% of its current age and making it the oldest known system of terrestrial-size planets. We thus show that Earth-size planets have formed throughout most of the universe's 13.8 billion year history, leaving open the possibility for the existence of ancient life in the Galaxy. The age of Kepler-444 not only suggests that thick-disk stars were among the hosts to the first Galactic planets, but may also help to pinpoint the beginning of the era of planet formation.},

The inferred rotation rates are 10\textendash{}30 days for the {$\approx$}0.2 M He degenerate cores on the RGB and 30\textendash{}100 days for the He burning core in a clump star. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Evolution code, we calculate state-of-the-art stellar evolution models of low mass rotating stars from the zero-age main sequence to the cooling white dwarf (WD) stage. We include transport of angular momentum due to rotationally induced instabilities and circulations, as well as magnetic fields in radiative zones (generated by the Tayler\textendash{}Spruit dynamo). We find that all models fail to predict core rotation as slow as observed on the RGB and during core He burning, implying that an unmodeled angular momentum transport process must be operating on the early RGB of low mass stars. Later evolution of the star from the He burning clump to the cooling WD phase appears to be at nearly constant core angular momentum. We also incorporate the adiabatic pulsation code, ADIPLS, to explicitly highlight this shortfall when applied to a specific Kepler asteroseismic target, KIC8366239.},

When coupling this information with classical determinations of stellar parameters, such as metallicities, effective temperatures, and angular diameters, powerful new diagnostics for Galactic studies can be obtained. The ongoing Stro\textasciidieresis{}mgren survey for Asteroseismology and Galactic Archaeology has the goal of transforming the Kepler field into a new benchmark for Galactic studies, similar to the solar neighborhood. Here we present the first results from a stripe centered at a Galactic longitude of 74{$\smwhtcircle$} and covering latitude from about 8{$\smwhtcircle$} to 20{$\smwhtcircle$}, which includes almost 1000 K giants with seismic information and the benchmark open cluster NGC 6819. We describe the coupling of classical and seismic parameters, the accuracy as well as the caveats of the derived effective temperatures, metallicities, distances, surface gravities, masses, and radii. Confidence in the achieved precision is corroborated by the detection of the first and secondary clumps in a population of field stars with a ratio of 2 to 1 and by the negligible scatter in the seismic distances among NGC 6819 member stars. An assessment of the reliability of stellar parameters in the Kepler Input Catalog is also performed, and the impact of our results for population studies in the Milky Way is discussed, along with the importance of an all-sky Stro\textasciidieresis{}mgren survey.},

  issn = {0035-8711, 1365-2966},
  abstract = {Intrinsically luminous giant stars in the Milky Way are the only potential volume-complete tracers of the distant disc, bulge, and halo. The chemical abundances of metal-poor giants also reflect the compositions of the earliest star-forming regions, providing the initial conditions for the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. However, the intrinsic rarity of metal-poor giants combined with the difficulty of efficiently identifying them with broad-band optical photometry has made it difficult to exploit them for studies of the Milky Way. One long-standing problem is that photometric selections for giant and/or metal-poor stars frequently include a large fraction of metal-rich dwarf contaminants. We re-derive a giant star photometric selection using existing public g-band and narrow-band DDO51 photometry obtained in the Kepler field. Our selection is simple and yields a contamination rate of main-sequence stars of 1 per cent and a completeness of about 80 per cent for giant stars with Teff 5250 K \textendash{}subject to the selection function of the spectroscopic surveys used to estimate these rates, and the magnitude range considered (11 g 15). While the DDO51 filter is known to be sensitive to stellar surface gravity, we further show that the mid-infrared colours of DDO51selected giants are strongly correlated with spectroscopic metallicity. This extends the infrared metal-poor selection developed by Schlaufman \& Casey, demonstrating that the principal contaminants in their selection can be efficiently removed by the photometric separation of dwarfs and giants. This implies that any similarly efficient dwarf/giant discriminant (e.g. Gaia parallaxes) can be used in conjunction with WISE colours to select samples of giant stars with high completeness and low contamination. We employ our photometric selection to identify three metal-poor giant candidates in the Kepler field with global asteroseismic parameters and find that masses inferred for these three stars using standard asteroseismic scaling relations are systematically overestimated by 20\textendash{}175 per cent. Taken at face value, this small sample size implies that standard asteroseismic scaling relations overpredict stellar masses for metal-poor giant stars.},

  abstract = {One of the most difficult properties to derive for stars is their age. For cool main-sequence stars, gyrochronology relations can be used to infer stellar ages from measured rotation periods and Hertzsprung Russell diagram positions. These relations have few calibrators with known ages for old, long rotation period stars. There is a significant sample of old Kepler objects of interest, or KOIs, which have both measurable surface rotation periods and precise asteroseismic measurements from which ages can be accurately derived. In this work, we determine the age and the rotation period of solar-like pulsating KOIs to both compare the rotation properties of stars with and without known planets and enlarge the gyrochronology calibration sample for old stars. We use Kepler photometric light curves to derive the stellar surface rotation periods while ages are obtained with asteroseismology using the Asteroseismic Modelling Portal in which individual mode frequencies are combined with high-resolution spectroscopic parameters. We thus determine surface rotation periods and ages for 11 planet-hosting stars, all over 2 Gyr old. We find that the planet-hosting stars exhibit a rotational behaviour that is consistent with the latest age-rotation models and similar to the rotational behaviour of stars without detected planets. We conclude that these old KOIs can be used to test and calibrate gyrochronology along with stars not known to host planets.},

  abstract = {Kepler allows the measurement of starspot variability in a large sample of field red giants for the first time. With a new method that combines autocorrelation and wavelet decomposition, we measure 361 rotation periods from the full set of 17 377 oscillating red giants in our sample. This represents 2.08\% of the stars, consistent with the fraction of spectroscopically detected rapidly rotating giants in the field. The remaining stars do not show enough variability to allow us to measure a reliable surface rotation period. Because the stars with detected rotation periods have measured oscillations, we can infer their global properties, e.g. mass and radius, and quantitatively evaluate the predictions of standard stellar evolution models as a function of mass. Consistent with results for cluster giants when we consider only the 4881 intermediate-mass stars, M {$>$} 2.0 M from our full red giant sample, we do not find the enhanced rates of rapid rotation expected from angular momentum conservation. We therefore suggest that either enhanced angular momentum loss or radial differential rotation must be occurring in these stars. Finally, when we examine the 575 low-mass (M {$<$} 1.1 M ) red clump stars in our sample, which were expected to exhibit slow (non-detectable) rotation, 15\% of them actually have detectable rotation. This suggests a high rate of interactions and stellar mergers on the red giant branch.},

  abstract = {We present preliminary asteroseismic results from Kepler on three G-type stars. The observations, made at oneminute cadence during the first 33.5 days of science operations, reveal high signal-to-noise solar-like oscillation spectra in all three stars: about 20 modes of oscillation may be clearly distinguished in each star. We discuss the appearance of the oscillation spectra, use the frequencies and frequency separations to provide first results on the radii, masses, and ages of the stars, and comment in the light of these results on prospects for inference on other solar-type stars that Kepler will observe.},

We consider two systems observed by the NASA Kepler mission which have multiple transiting small (super-Earth sized) planets: the previously reported Kepler-50 and a new system, Kepler-65, whose planets we validate in this paper. Both stars show rich spectra of solar-like oscillations. From the asteroseismic analysis we find that each host has its rotation axis nearly perpendicular to the line of sight with the sines of the angles constrained at the 1{$\sigma$} level to lie above 0.97 and 0.91, respectively. We use statistical arguments to show that coplanar orbits are favored in both systems, and that the orientations of the planetary orbits and the stellar rotation axis are correlated.},

  abstract = {We use asteroseismic data obtained by the NASA Kepler mission to estimate the fundamental properties of more than 500 main-sequence and sub-giant stars. Data obtained during the first 10 months of Kepler science operations were used for this work, when these solar-type targets were observed for one month each in survey mode. Stellar properties have been estimated using two global asteroseismic parameters and complementary photometric and spectroscopic data. Homogeneous sets of effective temperatures, Teff, were available for the entire ensemble from complementary photometry; spectroscopic estimates of Teff and [Fe/H] were available from a homogeneous analysis of ground-based data on a subset of 87 stars. We adopt a grid-based analysis, coupling six pipeline codes to 11 stellar evolutionary grids. Through use of these different grid-pipeline combinations we allow implicitly for the impact on the results of stellar model dependencies from commonly used grids, and differences in adopted pipeline methodologies. By using just two global parameters as the seismic inputs we are able to perform a homogenous analysis of all solar-type stars in the asteroseismic cohort, including many targets for which it would not be possible to provide robust estimates of individual oscillation frequencies (due to a combination of low signal-to-noise ratio and short dataset lengths). The median final quoted uncertainties from consolidation of the grid-based analyses are for the full ensemble (spectroscopic subset) approximately 10.8\% (5.4\%) in mass, 4.4\% (2.2\%) in radius, 0.017 dex (0.010 dex) in log g, and 4.3\% (2.8\%) in mean density. Around 36\% (57\%) of the stars have final age uncertainties smaller than 1 Gyr. These ages will be useful for ensemble studies, but should be treated carefully on a star-bystar basis. Future analyses using individual oscillation frequencies will offer significant improvements on up to 150 stars, in particular for estimates of the ages, where having the individual frequency data is most important.},

  abstract = {We consider the prospects for detecting solar-like oscillations in the `super-Nyquist' regime of long-cadence (LC) Kepler photometry, i.e. above the associated Nyquist frequency of 283 {$\mu$}Hz. Targets of interest are cool, evolved subgiants and stars lying at the base of the red giant branch. These stars would ordinarily be studied using the short-cadence (SC) data, since the associated SC Nyquist frequency lies well above the frequencies of the detectable oscillations. However, the number of available SC target slots is quite limited. This imposes a severe restriction on the size of the ensemble available for SC asteroseismic study. We find that archival Kepler LC data from the nominal mission may be utilized for asteroseismic studies of targets whose dominant oscillation frequencies lie as high as 500 {$\mu$}Hz, i.e. about 1.75-times the LC Nyquist frequency. The frequency detection threshold for the shorter duration science campaigns of the re-purposed Kepler mission, K2, is lower. The maximum threshold will probably lie somewhere between 400 and 450 {$\mu$}Hz. The potential to exploit the archival Kepler and K2 LC data in this manner opens the door to increasing significantly the number of subgiant and low-luminosity red giant targets amenable to asteroseismic analysis, overcoming target limitations imposed by the small number of SC slots. We estimate that around 400 such targets are now available for study in the Kepler LC archive. That number could potentially be a lot higher for K2, since there will be a new target list for each of its campaigns.},

  abstract = {Methods. Within the traditional approximation of rotation, we highlight the possibility of recovering the equidistance of period spacings by stretching the pulsation periods. The stretching function depends on the degree and azimuthal order of gravity modes and the rotation rate of the star. In this new stretched space, the pulsation modes are regularly spaced by the stellar buoyancy radius.
Results. On the basis of this property, we implemented a method to search for these new regularities and simultaneously infer the rotation frequency and buoyancy radius. Tests on synthetic spectra computed with a non-perturbative approach show that we can retrieve these two parameters with reasonable accuracy along with the mode identification. In uniformly rotating models of a typical {$\gamma$} Dor star, and for the most observed prograde dipole modes, we show that the accuracy on the derived parameters is better than 5\% on both the internal rotation rate and the buoyancy radius. Finally, we apply the method to two stars of the Kepler field, a {$\gamma$} Dor and an SPB, and compare our results with those of other existing methods.
Conclusions. We provide a stellar-model-independent method to obtain the near-core rotation rate, the buoyancy radius, and the mode identification from gravity-mode spectra of {$\gamma$} Dor and SPB stars.},

  abstract = {We present a variability analysis of the early-release first quarter of data publicly released by the Kepler project. Using the stellar parameters from the Kepler Input Catalog, we have separated the sample into 129,000 dwarfs and 17,000 giants and further sub-divided the luminosity classes into temperature bins corresponding approximately to the spectral classes A, F, G, K, and M. Utilizing the inherent sampling and time baseline of the public data set (30 minute sampling and 33.5 day baseline), we have explored the variability of the stellar sample. The overall variability rate of the dwarfs is 25\% for the entire sample, but can reach 100\% for the brightest groups of stars in the sample. G dwarfs are found to be the most stable with a dispersion floor of {$\sigma$} {$\sim$} 0.04 mmag. At the precision of Kepler, {$>$}95\% of the giant stars are variable with a noise floor of {$\sim$}0.1 mmag, 0.3 mmag, and 10 mmag for the G giants, K giants, and M giants, respectively. The photometric dispersion of the giants is consistent with acoustic variations of the photosphere; the photometrically derived predicted radial velocity distribution for the K giants is in agreement with the measured radial velocity distribution. We have also briefly explored the variability fraction as a function of data set baseline (1\textendash{}33 days), at the native 30 minute sampling of the public Kepler data. To within the limitations of the data, we find that the overall variability fractions increase as the data set baseline is increased from 1 day to 33 days, in particular for the most variable stars. The lower mass M dwarf, K dwarf, and G dwarf stars increase their variability more significantly than the higher mass F dwarf and A dwarf stars as the time baseline is increased, indicating that the variability of the lower mass stars is mostly characterized by timescales of weeks while the variability of the higher mass stars is mostly characterized by timescales of days. A study of the distribution of the variability as a function of galactic latitude suggests that sources closer to the galactic plane are more variable. This may be the result of sampling differing populations (i.e., ages) as a function of latitude or may be the result of higher background contamination that is inflating the variability fractions at lower latitudes. A comparison of the M dwarf statistics to the variability of 29 known bright M dwarfs indicates that the M dwarfs are primarily variable on timescales of weeks or longer presumably dominated by spots and binarity. On shorter timescales of hours, which are relevant for planetary transit detection, the stars are significantly less variable, with {$\sim$}80\% having 12 hr dispersions of 0.5 mmag or less.},

  abstract = {Large-scale analyses of stellar samples comprised of cool, solar-like oscillators now commonly utilize the so-called asteroseismic scaling relations to estimate fundamental stellar properties. In this paper, we present a test of the scaling relation for the global asteroseismic parameter {$\nu$}max, the frequency at which a solar-like oscillator presents its strongest observed pulsation amplitude. The classic relation assumes that this characteristic frequency scales with a particular combination of surface gravity and effective temperature that also describes the dependence of the cut-off frequency for acoustic waves in an isothermal atmosphere, i.e. {$\nu$}max {$\propto$} gTe-ff1/2. We test how well the oscillations of cool main-sequence and subgiant stars adhere to this relation, using a sample of asteroseismic targets observed by the NASA Kepler Mission. Our results, which come from a grid-based analysis, rule out departures from the classic gTe-ff1/2 scaling dependence at the level of 1.5 per cent over the full 1560 K range in Teff that we tested. There is some uncertainty over the absolute calibration of the scaling. However, any variation with Teff is evidently small, with limits similar to those above.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of 168 oscillating red giants from NASA's Kepler mission that exhibit anomalous peaks in their Fourier amplitude spectra. These peaks result from ellipsoidal variations that are indicative of binary star systems, at frequencies such that the orbit of any stellar companion would be within the convective envelope of the red giant. Alternatively, the observed phenomenon may be due to a close binary orbiting a red giant in a triple system, or chance alignments of foreground or background binary systems contaminating the target pixel aperture. We identify 87 stars in the sample as chance alignments using a combination of pixel Fourier analysis and difference imaging. We find that in the remaining 81 cases, the anomalous peaks are indistinguishable from the target star to within 4 arcsec, suggesting a physical association. We examine a GALAXIA model of the Kepler field of view to estimate background star counts and find that it is highly unlikely that all targets can be explained by chance alignments. From this, we conclude that these stars may comprise a population of physically associated systems.},

  abstract = {Detecting binary stars in photometric time series is traditionally done by measuring eclipses. This requires the orbital plane to be aligned with the observer. A new method without that requirement uses stellar oscillations to measure delays in the light arrival time and has been successfully applied to {$\delta$} Scuti stars. However, application to other types of stars has not been explored. To investigate this, we simulated light curves with a range of input parameters. We find a correlation between the signal to noise of the pulsation modes and the time delay required to detect binary motion. The detectability of the binarity in the simulations and in real, Kepler data show strong agreement, hence, we describe the factors that have prevented this method from discovering binary companions to stars belonging to various classes of pulsating stars.},

However, main-sequence F-type stars exhibit short mode lifetimes relative to their oscillation frequency, resulting in overlapping radial and quadrupole modes. The goal of this paper is to use the blended modes for asteroseismology in place of the individual separable modes. We used a peak-bagging method to measure the centroids of radial-quadrupole pairs for 66 stars from the Kepler LEGACY sample, as well as \texttheta{} Cyg, HD 49933, HD 181420, and Procyon. We used the relative quadrupole-mode visibility to estimate a theoretical centroid frequency from a grid of stellar oscillation models. The observed centroids were matched to the modelled centroids with empirical surface correction to calculate stellar parameters. We find that the stellar parameters returned using this approach agree with the results using individual mode frequencies for stars, where those are available. We conclude that the unresolved centroid frequencies can be used to perform asteroseismology with an accuracy similar to that based on individual mode frequencies.},

  abstract = {Poor modelling of the surface regions of solar-like stars causes a systematic discrepancy between the observed and model pulsation frequencies. We aim to characterize this frequency discrepancy for main-sequence solar-like oscillators for a wide range of initial masses and metallicities. We fit stellar models to the observed mode frequencies of the 67 stars, including the Sun, in the Kepler LEGACY sample, using three different empirical surface corrections. The three surface corrections we analyse are a frequency power-law, a cubic frequency term divided by the mode inertia and a linear combination of an inverse and cubic frequency term divided by the mode inertia. We construct a grid of stellar evolution models using the stellar evolution code MESA and calculate mode frequencies using GYRE. We scale the frequencies of each stellar model by an empirical calculated homology coefficient, which greatly improves the robustness of our grid. We calculate stellar parameters and surface corrections for each star using the average of the best-fitting models from each evolutionary track, weighted by the likelihood of each model. The resulting model stellar parameters agree well with an independent reference, the BASTA pipeline. However, we find that the adopted physics of the stellar models has a greater impact on the fitted stellar parameters than the choice of correction method. We find that scaling the frequencies by the mode inertia improves the fit between the models and observations. The inclusion of the inverse frequency term produces substantially better model fits to lower surface gravity stars.},

  volume = {452},
  issn = {0035-8711, 1365-2966},
  abstract = {The detection of mixed oscillation modes offers a unique insight into the internal structure of core helium burning (CHeB) stars. The stellar structure during CHeB is very uncertain because the growth of the convective core, and/or the development of a semiconvection zone, is critically dependent on the treatment of convective boundaries. In this study we calculate a suite of stellar structure models and their non-radial pulsations to investigate why the predicted asymptotic g-mode = 1 period spacing 1 is systematically lower than is inferred from Kepler field stars. We find that only models with large convective cores, such as those calculated with our newly proposed `maximal-overshoot' scheme, can match the average 1 reported. However, we also find another possible solution that is related to the method used to determine 1: mode trapping can raise the observationally inferred 1 well above its true value. Even after accounting for these two proposed resolutions to the discrepancy in average 1, models still predict more CHeB stars with low 1 ( 270 s) than are observed. We establish two possible remedies for this: (i) there may be a difficulty in determining 1 for early CHeB stars (when 1 is lowest) because of the effect that the sharp composition profile at the hydrogen burning shell has on the pulsations, or (ii) the mass of the helium core at the flash is higher than predicted. Our conclusions highlight the need for the reporting of selection effects in asteroseismic population studies in order to safely use this information to constrain stellar evolution theory.},

  volume = {472},
  issn = {0035-8711, 1365-2966},
  abstract = {Theoretical predictions for the core helium burning phase of stellar evolution are highly sensitive to the uncertain treatment of mixing at convective boundaries. In the last few years, interest in constraining the uncertain structure of their deep interiors has been renewed by insights from asteroseismology. Recently, Spruit proposed a limit for the rate of growth of helium-burning convective cores based on the higher buoyancy of material ingested from outside the convective core. In this paper we test the implications of such a limit for stellar models with a range of initial mass and metallicity. We find that the constraint on mixing beyond the Schwarzschild boundary has a significant effect on the evolution late in core helium burning, when core breathing pulses occur and the ingestion rate of helium is fastest. Ordinarily, core breathing pulses prolong the core helium burning lifetime to such an extent that models are at odds with observations of globular cluster populations. Across a wide range of initial stellar masses (0.83 {$\leq$} M/M {$\leq$} 5), applying the Spruit constraint reduces the core helium burning lifetime because core breathing pulses are either avoided or their number and severity reduced. The constraint suggested by Spruit therefore helps to resolve significant discrepancies between observations and theoretical predictions. Specifically, we find improved agreement for R2 (the observed ratio of asymptotic giant branch to horizontal branch stars in globular clusters), the luminosity difference between these two groups, and in asteroseismology, the mixed-mode period spacing detected in red clump stars in the Kepler field.},

Results. Metallicity causes a statistically significant change in the amplitude of the granulation activity, with a dependency stronger than that induced by both stellar mass and surface gravity. We also find that the metallicity has a significant impact on the corresponding time scales of the phenomenon. The effect of metallicity on the time scale is stronger than that of mass.
Conclusions. A higher metallicity increases the amplitude of granulation and meso-granulation signals and slows down their characteristic time scales toward longer periods. The trend in amplitude is in qualitative agreement with predictions from existing 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar atmospheres from main sequence to red giant stars. We confirm that the granulation activity is not sensitive to changes in the stellar core and that it only depends on the atmospheric parameters of stars.},

  abstract = {A large fraction of cool, low-mass stars exhibit brightness fluctuations that arise from a combination of convective granulation, acoustic oscillations, magnetic activity, and stellar rotation. Much of the short-timescale variability takes the form of stochastic noise, whose presence may limit the progress of extrasolar planet detection and characterization. In order to lay the groundwork for extracting useful information from these quasi-random signals, we focus on the origin of the granulation-driven component of the variability. We apply existing theoretical scaling relations to predict the star-integrated variability amplitudes for 508 stars with photometric light curves measured by the Kepler mission. We also derive an empirical correction factor that aims to account for the suppression of convection in F-dwarf stars with magnetic activity and shallow convection zones. So that we can make predictions of specific observational quantities, we performed Monte Carlo simulations of granulation light curves using a Lorentzian power spectrum. These simulations allowed us to reproduce the so-called flicker floor (i.e., a lower bound in the relationship between the full light-curve range and power in short-timescale fluctuations) that was found in the Kepler data. The Monte Carlo model also enabled us to convert the modeled fluctuation variance into a flicker amplitude directly comparable with observations. When the magnetic suppression factor described above is applied, the model reproduces the observed correlation between stellar surface gravity and flicker amplitude. Observationally validated models like these provide new and complementary evidence for a possible impact of magnetic activity on the properties of near-surface convection.},

We also determine the radius, mass, and age with precisions of 2\textendash{}5\%, 7\textendash{}11\%, and {$\sim$}35\%, respectively, using grid-based analyses. Coupling the stellar parameters with photometric data yields an asteroseismic distance with a precision better than 10\%. A v sin i measurement provides a rotational period-inclination correlation, and using the rotational periods from the recent literature, we constrain the stellar inclination for three of the stars. An Li abundance analysis yields an independent estimate of the age, but this is inconsistent with the asteroseismically determined age for one of the stars. We assess the performance of five grid-based analysis methods and find them all to provide consistent values of the surface gravity to {$\sim$}0.03 dex when both atmospheric and seismic constraints are at hand. The different grid-based analyses all yield fitted values of radius and mass to within 2.4{$\sigma$}, and taking the mean of these results reduces it to 1.5{$\sigma$}. The absence of a metallicity constraint when the average large frequency separation is measured with a precision of 1\% biases the fitted radius and mass for the stars with non-solar metallicity (metal-rich KIC 11395018 and metal-poor KIC 10273246), while including a metallicity constraint reduces the uncertainties in both of these parameters by almost a factor of two. We found that including the average small frequency separation improves the determination of the age only for KIC 11395018 and KIC 11234888, and for the latter this improvement was due to the lack of strong atmospheric constraints.},

  abstract = {The Kepler space telescope yielded unprecedented data for the study of solar-like oscillations in other stars. The large samples of multi-year observations posed an enormous data analysis challenge that has only recently been surmounted. Asteroseismic modeling has become more sophisticated over time, with better methods gradually developing alongside the extended observations and improved data analysis techniques. We apply the latest version of the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal (AMP) to the full-length Kepler data sets for 57 stars, comprising planetary hosts, binaries, solar-analogs, active stars, and for validation purposes, the Sun. From an analysis of the derived stellar properties for the full sample, we identify a variation of the mixing-length parameter with atmospheric properties. We also derive a linear relation between the stellar age and a characteristic frequency separation ratio. In addition, we find that the empirical correction for surface effects suggested by Kjeldsen and coworkers is adequate for solar-type stars that are not much hotter (Teff {$<\sim$} 6200 K) or significantly more evolved (log g {$>\sim$} 4.2, {$\increment\nu$} {$>\sim$} 80 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz) than the Sun. Precise parallaxes from the Gaia mission and future observations from TESS and PLATO promise to improve the reliability of stellar properties derived from asteroseismology.},

  abstract = {The Kepler satellite has provided photometric timeseries data of unprecedented length, duty cycle and precision. To fully analyse these data for the tens of thousands of stars observed by Kepler, automated methods are a prerequisite. Here, we present an automated procedure to determine the period spacing of gravity modes in red giant stars ascending the red giant branch. The gravity modes reside in a cavity in the deep interior of the stars and provide information on the conditions in the stellar core. However, for red giants the gravity modes are not directly observable on the surface, hence this method is based on the pressure-gravity mixed modes that present observable features in the Fourier power spectrum. The method presented here is based on the vertical alignment and symmetry of these mixed modes in a period echelle diagram. We find that we can obtain reliable results for both model frequencies and observed frequencies. Additionally, we carried out Monte Carlo tests to obtain realistic uncertainties on the period spacings with different set of oscillation modes (for the models) and uncertainties on the frequencies. Furthermore, this method has been used to improve mode detection and identification of the observed frequencies in an iterative manner.},

The rotation period bimodality, originally discovered by McQuillan et al. (2013), is clearly recovered for stars out to 525pc, but is not detectable at further distances. This bimodality correlates with Galactic height as well, dropping strongly for stars above Z {$>$} 90 pc. We also find a significant width in the stellar main sequence of {$\increment$}MG {$\sim$}0.25 mag, as well as a coherent gradient of increasing rotation periods orthogonal to the main sequence. We interpret this as a signature of stellar angular momentum loss over time, implying a corresponding diagonal age gradient across the main sequence. Stellar evolution models predict changes in color and luminosity that are consistent in amplitude, but not in direction, with those required to produce the gradient we have detected. This rotation gradient suggests that main sequence evolution produces offsets in color\textendash{}magnitude space that are significantly more orthogonal to the zero-age main sequence than models currently predict, and may provide new tests for both stellar evolution and gyrochronology models.},

We present a correction for these Doppler shifts and use previously published pulsation frequencies to demonstrate the significance of the effect.

In addition, we expand the methodology of quality assurance using a Bayesian unsupervised machine learning approach. We report the measured frequencies of the modes of oscillation for all 35 stars and frequency ratios commonly used in detailed asteroseismic modelling. Due to the high correlations associated with frequency ratios we report the covariance matrix of all frequencies measured and frequency ratios calculated. These frequencies, frequency ratios, and covariance matrices can be used to obtain tight constraint on the fundamental parameters of these planet-hosting stars.},

  abstract = {Methods. We computed models of the two stars that precisely fit the observed seismic frequencies. We used the Toulouse Geneva Evolution Code (TGEC), which includes complete atomic diffusion (including radiative accelerations). We compared the predicted surface abundances with the spectroscopic observations and confirm that another mixing process is needed. We then included the effect of accretion-induced fingering convection.
Results. The accretion of planetary matter does not change the metal abundances but leads to lithium destruction, which depends upon the accreted mass. A fraction of the Earth's mass is enough to explain the lithium surface abundances of 16 Cygni B. We also checked the beryllium abundances.
Conclusions. In the case of accretion of heavy matter onto stellar surfaces, the accreted heavy elements do not remain in the outer convective zones, but are mixed downwards by fingering convection induced by the unstable {$\mu$}-gradient. Depending on the accreted mass, this mixing process may transport lithium down to its nuclear destruction layers and lead to an extra lithium depletion at the surface. A fraction of the Earth's mass is enough to explain a lithium ratio of 4.7 in the 16 Cygni system. In this case beryllium is not destroyed. Such a process may be frequent in planet-hosting stars and should be studied in other cases in the future.},

  abstract = {Methods. We implemented the calculation of radiative accelerations operating on C, N, O, Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, and Fe in the CESTAM code using the single-valued parameter method. We built and compared several grids of stellar models including gravitational settling, some with and others without radiative accelerations. We considered masses in the range [0.9, 1.5] M and three values of the metallicity around the solar value. For each metallicity we determined the mass range where differences between models due to radiative accelerations exceed the uncertainties of global seismic parameters of the Kepler Legacy sample or expected for PLATO observations.
Results. We found that radiative accelerations may not be neglected for stellar masses higher than 1.1 M at solar metallicity. The difference in age due to their inclusion in models can reach 9\% for the more massive stars of our grids. We estimated that the percentage of the PLATO core program stars whose modelling would require radiative accelerations ranges between 33\% and 58\% depending on the precision of the seismic data.
Conclusions. We conclude that in the context of Kepler, TESS, and PLATO missions which provide (or will provide) high-quality seismic data, radiative accelerations can have a significant effect when properly inferring the properties of solar-like oscillators. This is particularly important for age inferences. However, the net effect for each individual star results from the competition between atomic diffusion including radiative accelerations and other internal transport processes. Rotationally induced transport processes for instance are believed to reduce the effects of atomic diffusion. This will be investigated in a forthcoming companion paper.},

  abstract = {Rotation is expected to have an important influence on the structure and the evolution of stars. However, the mechanisms of angular momentum transport in stars remain theoretically uncertain and very complex to take into account in stellar models. To achieve a better understanding of these processes, we desperately need observational constraints on the internal rotation of stars, which until very recently was restricted to the Sun. In this paper, we report the detection of mixed modes\textemdash{}i.e., modes that behave both as g modes in the core and as p modes in the envelope\textemdash{}in the spectrum of the early red giant KIC 7341231, which was observed during one year with the Kepler spacecraft. By performing an analysis of the oscillation spectrum of the star, we show that its non-radial modes are clearly split by stellar rotation and we are able to determine precisely the rotational splittings of 18 modes. We then find a stellar model that reproduces very well the observed atmospheric and seismic properties of the star. We use this model to perform inversions of the internal rotation profile of the star, which enables us to show that the core of the star is rotating at least five times faster than the envelope. This will shed new light on the processes of transport of angular momentum in stars. In particular, this result can be used to place constraints on the angular momentum coupling between the core and the envelope of early red giants, which could help us discriminate between the theories that have been proposed over the last few decades.},

  abstract = {Methods. We first extracted the rotational splittings and frequencies of the modes for six young Kepler red giants. We then performed a seismic modeling of these stars using the evolutionary codes Cesam2k and astec. By using the observed splittings and the rotational kernels of the optimal models, we inverted the internal rotation profiles of the six stars.
Results. We obtain estimates of the core rotation rates for these stars, and upper limits to the rotation in their convective envelope. We show that the rotation contrast between the core and the envelope increases during the subgiant branch. Our results also suggest that the core of subgiants spins up with time, while their envelope spins down. For two of the stars, we show that a discontinuous rotation profile with a deep discontinuity reproduces the observed splittings significantly better than a smooth rotation profile. Interestingly, the depths that are found to be most probable for the discontinuities roughly coincide with the location of the H-burning shell, which separates the layers that contract from those that expand.
Conclusions. We characterized the differential rotation pattern of six young giants with a range of metallicities, and with both radiative and convective cores on the main sequence. This will bring observational constraints to the scenarios of angular momentum transport in stars. Moreover, if the existence of sharp gradients in the rotation profiles of young red giants is confirmed, it is expected to help in distinguishing between the physical processes that could transport angular momentum in the subgiant and red giant branches.},

  abstract = {Methods. We select a subsample of Kepler secondary clump stars with mixed modes that are clearly rotationally split. By applying a thorough statistical analysis, we show that the splittings of gravity-dominated modes (trapped in central regions) and of p-dominated modes (trapped in the envelope) can be measured. We then use these splittings to estimate the amount of differential rotation by using inversion techniques and by applying a simplified approach based on asymptotic theory.
Results. We obtain evidence for a weak radial differential rotation for six of the seven targets that were selected, with the central regions rotating from 1.8 {$\pm$} 0.3 to 3.2 {$\pm$} 1.0 times faster than the envelope. The last target is found to be consistent with a solid-body rotation.
Conclusions. This demonstrates that an efficient redistribution of angular momentum occurs after the end of the main sequence in the interior of intermediate-mass stars, either during the short-lived subgiant phase or once He-burning has started in the core. In either case, this should bring constraints on the angular momentum transport mechanisms that are at work.},

  shorttitle = {Measuring the Extent of Convective Cores in Low-Mass Stars Using {{{\emph{Kepler}}}} Data},
  abstract = {Methods. We first tested and validated a seismic diagnostic that was proposed to probe the extent of convective cores in a modeldependent way using the so-called r010 ratios, which are built with l = 0 and l = 1 modes. We applied this procedure to 24 low-mass stars chosen among Kepler targets to optimize the efficiency of this diagnostic. For this purpose, we computed grids of stellar models with both the Cesam2k and mesa evolution codes, where the extensions of convective cores were modeled either by an instantaneous mixing or as a diffusion process.
Results. We found that 10 stars in our sample are in fact subgiants. Among the other targets, were able to unambiguously detect convective cores in eight stars, and we obtained seismic measurements of the extent of the mixed core in these targets with a good agreement between the Cesam2k and mesa codes. By performing optimizations using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, we then obtained estimates of the amount of extra mixing beyond the core that is required in Cesam2k to reproduce seismic observations for these eight stars, and we showed that this can be used to propose a calibration of this quantity. This calibration depends on the prescription chosen for the extra mixing, but we found that it should also be valid for the code mesa, provided the same prescription is used.
Conclusions. This study constitutes a first step toward calibrating the extension of convective cores in low-mass stars, which will help reduce the uncertainties on the ages of these stars.},

  title = {Near-Degeneracy Effects on the Frequencies of Rotationally-Split Mixed Modes in Red Giants},
  volume = {605},
  issn = {0004-6361, 1432-0746},
  abstract = {Methods. We show that in the cases where asymmetrical multiplets were detected, near-degeneracy effects are expected to occur, because of the combined effects of rotation and mode mixing. Such effects have not been taken into account so far. By using both perturbative and non-perturbative approaches, we show that near-degeneracy effects produce multiplet asymmetries that are very similar to the observations. We then propose and validate a method based on the perturbative approach to probe the internal rotation of red giants using multiplet asymmetries.
Results. We successfully apply our method to the asymmetrical l = 2 multiplets of the Kepler young red giant KIC 7341231 and obtain precise estimates of its mean rotation in the core and the envelope. The observed asymmetries are reproduced with a good statistical agreement, which confirms that near-degeneracy effects are very likely the cause of the detected multiplet asymmetries.
Conclusions. We expect near-degeneracy effects to be important for l = 2 mixed modes all along the red giant branch (RGB). For l = 1 modes, these effects can be neglected only at the base of the RGB. They must therefore be taken into account when interpreting rotational splittings and as shown here, they can bring valuable information about the internal rotation of red giants.},

The data reveal significant cycle-to-cycle fluctuations in the pulsation period, indicating that classical Cepheids may not be as accurate astrophysical clocks as commonly believed: regardless of the specific points used to determine the O - C values, the cycle lengths show a scatter of 0.015\textendash{}0.02 d over 120 cycles covered by the observations. A very slight correlation between the individual Fourier parameters and the O - C values was found, suggesting that the O - C variations might be due to the instability of the light-curve shape. Random-fluctuation tests revealed a linear trend up to a cycle difference 15, but for long term, the period remains around the mean value. We compare the measurements with simulated light curves that were constructed to mimic V1154 Cyg as a perfect pulsator modulated only by the light travel time effect caused by low-mass companions. We show that the observed period jitter in V1154 Cyg represents a serious limitation in the search for binary companions. While the Kepler data are accurate enough to allow the detection of planetary bodies in close orbits around a Cepheid, the astrophysical noise can easily hide the signal of the light-time effect.},

  abstract = {We study the dynamics of the stellar interior of the early red-giant star KIC4448777 by asteroseismic inversion of 14 splittings of the dipole mixed modes obtained from Kepler observations. In order to overcome the complexity of the oscillation pattern typical of red-giant stars, we present a procedure to extract the rotational splittings from the power spectrum. We find not only that the core rotates from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 17 times faster than the surface, confirming previous inversion results generated for other red giants (Deheuvels et al.), but we also estimate the variation of the angular velocity within the helium core with a spatial resolution of 0.001R and verify the hypothesis of a sharp discontinuity in the inner stellar rotation. The results show that the entire core rotates rigidly and provide evidence for an angular velocity gradient around the base of the hydrogen-burning shell; however, we do not succeed in characterizing the rotational slope, due to the intrinsic limits of the applied techniques. The angular velocity, from the edge of the core, appears to decrease with increasing distance from the center, reaching an average value in the convective envelope of 68{$\pm$}22nHz. We conclude that a set of data that includes only dipolar modes is sufficient to infer quite accurately the rotation of a red giant not only in the dense core but also, with a lower level of confidence, in part of the radiative region and in the convective envelope.},

We adopted the Bayesian inference code DIAMONDS for the peak bagging analysis and asteroseismic splitting inversion methods to derive the internal rotational profile of the star. The detection of new splittings of mixed modes, which are more concentrated in the very inner part of the helium core, allowed us to reconstruct the angular velocity profile deeper into the interior of the star and to disentangle the details better than in Paper I: the helium core rotates almost rigidly about 6 times faster than the convective envelope, while part of the hydrogen shell seems to rotate at a constant velocity about 1.15 times lower than the He core. In particular, we studied the internal shear layer between the fast-rotating radiative interior and the slow convective zone and we found that it lies partially inside the hydrogen shell above r;0.05R and extends across the core\textendash{}envelope boundary. Finally, we theoretically explored the possibility for the future capabilty to sound the convective envelope in the red-giant stars and we concluded that the inversion of a set of splittings with only low-harmonic degree l3, even supposing a very large number of modes, will not allow us to resolve the rotational profile of this region in detail.},

Thanks to the unprecedented data quality obtained by space missions, particularly CoRoT and Kepler, invaluable information is extracted from the high-precision stellar oscillation frequencies, which provide very strong constraints on possible stellar models for a given set of classical observations. In this work, we have characterized two relatively faint stars, KIC 10920273 and KIC 11395018, using oscillation data from Kepler photometry and atmospheric constraints from ground-based spectroscopy. Both stars have very similar atmospheric properties; however, using the individual frequencies extracted from the Kepler data, we have determined quite distinct global properties, with increased precision compared to that of earlier results. We found that both stars have left the main sequence and characterized them as follows: KIC 10920273 is a one-solar-mass star (M = 1.00 {$\pm$} 0.04 M ), but much older than our Sun (t = 7.12 {$\pm$} 0.47 Gyr), while KIC 11395018 is significantly more massive than the Sun (M = 1.27 {$\pm$} 0.04 M ) with an age close to that of the Sun (t = 4.57 {$\pm$} 0.23 Gyr). We confirm that the high lithium abundance reported for these stars should not be considered to represent young ages, as we precisely determined them to be evolved subgiants. We discuss the use of surface lithium abundance, rotation, and activity relations as potential age diagnostics.},

The rotation periods of the dwarfs, ranging from 6 to 30 days and averaging 19 days, allow us to assess their individual evolutionary states on the main sequence and to derive their ages using gyrochronology.

KIC 2569073 (V = 14.22), is a particularly interesting variable Ap star that we discovered in the NGC 6791 superstamp. With a rotational period of 14.67 d and 0.034 mag variability, it has one of the largest peak-to-peak variations of any known Ap star. Colour photometry reveals an antiphase correlation between the B band, and the V, R and I bands. This Ap star is a rotational variable, also known as an {$\alpha$}2 CVn star, and is one of only a handful of Ap stars observed by Kepler. While no change in spot period or amplitude is observed within the 4 yr Kepler time series, the amplitude shows a large increase compared to ground-based photometry obtained two decades ago.},

  abstract = {Context. Recent asteroseismic observations have led to the determination of rotational frequency splittings for = 1 mixed modes in red giants. Aims. We investigate how these observed splittings can constrain the modelling of the physical processes transporting angular momentum in stellar interiors. Methods. We first compare models including a comprehensive treatment of shellular rotation only, with the rotational splittings observed for the red giant KIC 8366239. We then study how these asteroseismic constraints can give us information about the efficiency of an additional mechanism for the internal transport of angular momentum. This is done by computing rotating models of KIC 8366239 that include a constant viscosity corresponding to this physical process, in addition to the treatment of shellular rotation. Results. We find that models of red giant stars including shellular rotation only predict steep rotation profiles, which are incompatible with the measurements of rotational splittings in the red giant KIC 8366239. Meridional circulation and shear mixing alone are found to produce an insufficient internal coupling so that an additional mechanism for the internal transport of angular momentum is needed during the post-main sequence evolution. We show that the viscosity {$\nu$}add corresponding to this mechanism is strongly constrained to be {$\nu$}add = 3 \texttimes{} 104 cm2 s-1 thanks to the observed ratio of the splittings for modes in the wings to those at the centre of the dipole forests. Such a value of viscosity may suggest that the same unknown physical process is at work during the main sequence and the post-main sequence evolution.},

  abstract = {Determining the ages of red-giant stars is a key problem in stellar astrophysics. One of the difficulties in this determination is to know the evolutionary state of the individual stars \textendash{} i.e. have they started to burn Helium in their cores? That is the topic of this paper. Asteroseismic data provide a route to achieving this information. What we present here is a highly autonomous way of determining the evolutionary state from an analysis of the power spectrum of the light curve. The method is fast and efficient and can provide results for a large number of stars. It uses the structure of the dipole-mode oscillations, which have a mixed character in red-giant stars, to determine some measures that are used in the categorization. It does not require that all the individual components of any given mode be separately characterized. Some 6604 redgiant stars have been classified. Of these, 3566 are determined to be on the red-giant branch, 2077 are red-clump and 439 are secondary-clump stars. We do not specifically identify the low-metallicity, horizontal-branch stars. The difference between red-clump and secondaryclump stars is dependent on the manner in which Helium burning is first initiated. We discuss that the way the boundary between these classifications is set may lead to mis-categorization in a small number of stars. The remaining 522 stars were not classified either because they lacked sufficient power in the dipole modes (so-called depressed dipole modes) or because of conflicting values in the parameters.},

  abstract = {Fundamental stellar properties, such as mass, radius, and age, can be inferred using asteroseismology. Cool stars with convective envelopes have turbulent motions that can stochastically drive and damp pulsations. The properties of the oscillation frequency power spectrum can be tied to mass and radius through solar-scaled asteroseismic relations. Stellar properties derived using these scaling relations need verification over a range of metallicities. Because the age and mass of halo stars are well-constrained by astrophysical priors, they provide an independent, empirical check on asteroseismic mass estimates in the low-metallicity regime. We identify nine metal-poor red giants (including six stars that are kinematically associated with the halo) from a sample observed by both the Kepler space telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III APOGEE spectroscopic survey. We compare masses inferred using asteroseismology to those expected for halo and thick-disk stars. Although our sample is small, standard scaling relations, combined with asteroseismic parameters from the APOKASC Catalog, produce masses that are systematically higher ( {$\Delta$}M = 0.17 {$\pm$} 0.05 M ) than astrophysical expectations. The magnitude of the mass discrepancy is reduced by known theoretical corrections to the measured large frequency separation scaling relationship. Using alternative methods for measuring asteroseismic parameters induces systematic shifts at the 0.04 M level. We also compare published asteroseismic analyses with scaling relationship masses to examine the impact of using the frequency of maximum power as a constraint. Upcoming APOKASC observations will provide a larger sample of {$\sim$}100 metal-poor stars, important for detailed asteroseismic characterization of Galactic stellar populations.},

While the first parts of the pipeline extracted overall oscillation parameters of the stars, here we present a significant extension to that pipeline designed in order to extract individual mode frequencies and amplitudes. The pipeline also attempts to label the detected modes by straightening and then identifying the ridges within the echelle diagrams in an automated manner. Tests have been performed on artificial stars and the pipeline is shown to return estimates of the mode frequencies that are in line with the input parameters. There does appear to be some positive bias in the returned value of the mode amplitudes which must be accounted for when employing the pipeline for real data.},

We have reanalyzed this system using the full span of 3.5 years of Kepler photometric data, and obtained improved information about its star and the planets. A detailed asteroseismic analysis of the extended time series provides a significant improvement on the stellar parameters: not only can we state that Kepler-10 is the oldest known rocky-planet-harboring system at 10.41 {$\pm$} 1.36 Gyr, but these parameters combined with improved planetary parameters from new transit fits gives us the radius of Kepler-10b to within just 125 km.

  abstract = {The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even with large data sets. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a popular class of models used for this purpose, but since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small data sets. In this paper, we present a novel method for GPs modeling in one dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the data set. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series data sets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillators\textemdash{}providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice\textemdash{}but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable GP methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

We detect a total of 251 periodicities, most in the g-mode domain, but some where pmodes occur, confirming that KIC 3527751 is a hybrid pulsator. We apply seismic tools to the periodicities to characterize the properties of KIC 3527751. Techniques to identify modes include asymptotic period spacing relationships, frequency multiplets, and the separation of multiplet splittings. These techniques allow for 189 (75\%) of the 251 periods to be associated with pulsation modes. Included in these are three sets of {$\mathscr{l}$} = 4 multiplets and possibly an {$\mathscr{l}$} = 9 multiplet. Period spacing sequences indicate {$\mathscr{l}$} = 1 and 2 overtone spacings of 266.4 {$\pm$} 0.2 and 153.2 {$\pm$} 0.2 s, respectively. We also calculate reduced periods, from which we find evidence of trapped pulsations. Such mode trappings can be used to constrain the core/atmosphere transition layers. Interestingly, frequency multiplets in the g-mode region, which sample deep into the star, indicate a rotation period of 42.6 {$\pm$} 3.4 days while p-mode multiplets, which sample the outer envelope, indicate a rotation period of 15.3 {$\pm$} 0.7 days. We interpret this as differential rotation in the radial direction with the core rotating more slowly. This is the first example of differential rotation for a sdB star.},

Results. We measured the masses and radii of the stars in the dEB, and the classical parameters Teff, log g, and [Fe/H] from the spectra and ground-based photometry. The RG component of KIC 8410637 is most likely in the core helium-burning red clump phase of evolution and has an age and composition that are very similar to the stars in the open cluster NGC 6819. The mass of the RG in KIC 8410637 should therefore be similar to the mass of RGs in NGC 6819, thus lending support to the latest version of the asteroseismic scaling relations. This is the first direct measurement of both mass and radius for an RG to be compared with values for RGs from asteroseismic scaling relations thereby providing an accurate comparison. We find excellent agreement between log g values derived from the binary analysis and asteroseismic scaling relations.
Conclusions. We have determined the masses and radii of the two stars in the binary accurately. A detailed asteroseismic analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper, allowing an informative comparison between the parameters determined for the dEB and from asteroseismology.},

The hierarchical structure of a triple system produces tidal forcing at high frequencies unobtainable in binary systems, allowing for the tidal excitation of high frequency pmodes in the stellar components. The tidal forcing exists even for circular, aligned, and synchronized systems. We calculate the magnitude and frequencies of three body tidal forcing on the central primary star for circular and coplanar orbits, and we estimate the amplitude of the tidally excited oscillation modes. We also calculate the secular orbital changes induced by the tidally excited modes, and show that they can cause significant orbital decay. During certain phases of stellar evolution, the tidal dissipation may be greatly enhanced by resonance locking. We then compare our theory to observations of HD 181068, which is a hierarchical triply eclipsing star system in the Kepler field of view. The observed oscillation frequencies in HD 181068 can be naturally explained by three body tidal effects. We then compare the observed oscillation amplitudes and phases in HD 181068 to our predictions, finding mostly good agreement. Finally, we discuss the past and future evolution of compact triple systems like HD 181068.},

  abstract = {Tidal dissipation in binary star and planetary systems is poorly understood. Fortunately, eccentric binaries known as heartbeat stars often exhibit tidally excited oscillations, providing observable diagnostics of tidal circularization mechanisms and time-scales. We apply tidal theories to observations of the heartbeat star KIC 8164262, which contains an F-type primary in a very eccentric orbit that exhibits a prominent tidally excited oscillation. We demonstrate that the prominent oscillation is unlikely to result from a chance resonance between tidal forcing and a stellar oscillation mode. However, the oscillation has a frequency and amplitude consistent with the prediction of resonance locking, a mechanism in which coupled stellar and orbital evolution maintain a stable resonance between tidal forcing and a stellar oscillation mode. The resonantly excited mode produces efficient tidal dissipation (corresponding to an effective tidal quality factor Q {$\sim$} 5 \texttimes{} 104), such that tidal orbital decay/circularization proceeds on a stellar evolution time-scale.},

  abstract = {NASA's Kepler mission is providing basic asteroseismic data for hundreds of stars. One of the more common ways of determining stellar characteristics from these data is by the so-called grid-based modeling. We have made a detailed study of grid-based analysis techniques to study the errors (and error correlations) involved. As had been reported earlier, we find that it is relatively easy to get very precise values of stellar radii using grid-based techniques. However, we find that there are small, but significant, biases that can result because of the grid of models used. The biases can be minimized if metallicity is known. Masses cannot be determined as precisely as the radii and suffer from larger systematic effects. We also find that the errors in mass and radius are correlated. A positive consequence of this correlation is that log g can be determined both precisely and accurately with almost no systematic biases. Radii and log g can be determined with almost no model dependence to within 5\% for realistic estimates of errors in asteroseismic and conventional observations. Errors in mass can be somewhat higher unless accurate metallicity estimates are available. Age estimates of individual stars are the most model dependent. The errors are larger, too. However, we find that for star clusters, it is possible to get a relatively precise age if one assumes that all stars in a given cluster have the same age.},

NASA's Kepler mission is providing individual eigenfrequencies for a huge number of stars, including thousands of red giants. Besides the frequencies of acoustic modes, an important breakthrough of the Kepler mission is the detection of nonradial gravitydominated mixed-mode oscillations in red giants. Unlike pure acoustic modes, mixed modes probe deeply into the interior of stars, allowing the stellar core properties and evolution of stars to be derived. In this work, using the gravity-mode period spacing and the large frequency separation, we construct the {$\Delta\Pi$}1\textendash{$\Delta\nu$} asteroseismic diagram from models of subgiants and red giants with various masses and metallicities. The relationship {$\Delta\Pi$}1\textendash{$\Delta\nu$} is able to constrain the ages and masses of the subgiants. Meanwhile, for red giants with masses above 1.5 Me, the {$\Delta\Pi$}1\textendash{$\Delta\nu$} asteroseismic diagram can also work well to constrain the stellar age and mass. Additionally, we calculate the relative ``isochrones'' {$\tau$}, which indicate similar evolution states especially for similar mass stars, on the {$\Delta\Pi$}1\textendash{$\Delta\nu$} diagram.},

In this paper, we have modeled the asteroseismic and spectroscopic data of the stars, and have determined their convection-zone helium abundances using the signatures left by the He II ionization zone on the mode frequencies. As expected, we find that the components of the binary are of the same age within uncertainties (3.087 {$\pm$} 0.580 Gyr and 3.569 {$\pm$} 0.912 Gyr); they also have the same initial helium abundance (Yinit=0.253 {$\pm$} 0.006 and 0.254 {$\pm$} 0.008). Their current metallicity ([Fe/H]=-0.275 {$\pm$} 0.04 and -0.285 {$\pm$} 0.04) is also the same within errors. Fits to the signature of the He II acoustic glitch yield current helium abundances of YA=0.224{$\pm$}0.006 and YB=0.233{$\pm$}0.008 for the two components. Analyzing the complete ensemble of models generated for this investigation, we find that both the amplitude and acoustic depth of the glitch signature arising from the second helium ionization zone and the base of the convection zone (CZ) are functions of mass. We show that the acoustic depths of these glitches are positively correlated with each other. The analysis can help us to detect the internal structure and constrain the chemical compositions.},

  abstract = {Kepler ultra-high precision photometry of long and continuous observations provides a unique dataset in which surface rotation and variability can be studied for thousands of stars. Because many of these old field stars also have independently measured asteroseismic ages, measurements of rotation and activity are particularly interesting in the context of age-rotation-activity relations. In particular, age-rotation relations generally lack good calibrators at old ages, a problem that this Kepler sample of old-field stars is uniquely suited to address. We study the surface rotation and photometric magnetic activity of a subset of 540 solar-like stars on the mainsequence and the subgiant branch for which stellar pulsations have been measured. The rotation period was determined by comparing the results from two different analysis methods: i) the projection onto the frequency domain of the time-period analysis, and ii) the autocorrelation function of the light curves. Reliable surface rotation rates were then extracted by comparing the results from two different sets of calibrated data and from the two complementary analyses. General photometric levels of magnetic activity in this sample of stars were also extracted by using a photometric activity index, which takes into account the rotation period of the stars. We report rotation periods for 310 out of 540 targets (excluding known binaries and candidate planet-host stars); our measurements span a range of 1 to 100 days. The photometric magnetic activity levels of these stars were computed, and for 61.5\% of the dwarfs, this level is similar to the range, from minimum to maximum, of the solar magnetic activity. We demonstrate that hot dwarfs, cool dwarfs, and subgiants have very different rotation-age relationships, highlighting the importance of separating out distinct populations when interpreting stellar rotation periods. Our sample of cool dwarf stars with age and metallicity data of the highest quality is consistent with gyrochronology relations reported in the literature.},

  abstract = {Methods. We used Kepler short- and long-cadence data combined with spectroscopic observations to infer the stellar structure and dynamics of KIC 8561221. We then discussed different scenarios that could contribute to reducing the dipole amplitudes, such as a fast-rotating interior or the effect of a magnetic field on the properties of the modes. We also performed a detailed study of the inertia and damping of the modes.
Results. We have been able to characterise 36 oscillations modes, in particular, a few dipole modes above {$\nu$}max that exhibit nearly normal amplitudes. The frequencies of all the measured modes were used to determine the overall properties and the internal structure of the star. We have inferred a surface rotation period of {$\sim$}91 days and uncovered a variation in the surface magnetic activity during the last 4 years. The analysis of the convective background did not reveal any difference compared to ``normal'' red giants. As expected, the internal regions of the star probed by the = 2 and 3 modes spin 4 to 8 times faster than the surface.
Conclusions. With our grid of standard models we are able to properly fit the observed frequencies. Our model calculation of mode inertia and damping give no explanation for the depressed dipole modes. A fast-rotating core is also ruled out as a possible explanation. Finally, we do not have any observational evidence of a strong deep magnetic field inside the star.},

  abstract = {Red giant stars are proving to be an incredible source of information for testing models of stellar evolution, as asteroseismology has opened up a window into their interiors. Such insights are a direct result of the unprecedented data from space missions CoRoT and Kepler as well as recent theoretical advances. Eclipsing binaries are also fundamental astrophysical objects, and when coupled with asteroseismology, binaries provide two independent methods to obtain masses and radii and exciting opportunities to develop highly constrained stellar models. The possibility of discovering pulsating red giants in eclipsing binary systems is therefore an important goal that could potentially offer very robust characterization of these systems. Until recently, only one case has been discovered with Kepler. We cross-correlate the detected red giant and eclipsing-binary catalogs from Kepler data to find possible candidate systems. Light-curve modeling and mean properties measured from asteroseismology are combined to yield specific measurements of periods, masses, radii, temperatures, eclipse timing variations, core rotation rates, and red giant evolutionary state. After using three different techniques to eliminate false positives, out of the 70 systems common to the red giant and eclipsing-binary catalogs we find 13 strong candidates (12 previously unknown) to be eclipsing binaries, one to be a non-eclipsing binary with tidally induced oscillations, and 10 more to be hierarchical triple systems, all of which include a pulsating red giant. The systems span a range of orbital eccentricities, periods, and spectral types F, G, K, and M for the companion of the red giant. One case even suggests an eclipsing binary composed of two red giant stars and another of a red giant with a {$\delta$}-Scuti star. The discovery of multiple pulsating red giants in eclipsing binaries provides an exciting test bed for precise astrophysical modeling, and follow-up spectroscopic observations of many of the candidate systems are encouraged. The resulting highly constrained stellar parameters will allow, for example, the exploration of how binary tidal interactions affect pulsations when compared to the single-star case.},

A careful analysis of the corresponding Kepler light curves shows that modes with amplitudes that are usually observed in red giants would have been detected if they were present. We observe that mode depletion is strongly associated with shortperiod systems, in which stellar radii account for 16\%\textendash{}24\% of the semi-major axis, and where red-giant surface activity is detected. We suggest that when the rotational and orbital periods synchronize in close binaries, the red-giant component is spun up, so that a dynamo mechanism starts and generates a magnetic field, leading to observable stellar activity. Pressure modes would then be damped as acoustic waves dissipate in these fields.},

  abstract = {Given the potential of ensemble asteroseismology for understanding fundamental properties of large numbers of stars, it is critical to determine the accuracy of the scaling relations on which these measurements are based. From several powerful validation techniques, all indications so far show that stellar radius estimates from the asteroseismic scaling relations are accurate to within a few percent. Eclipsing binary systems hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like oscillations constitute the ideal test objects for validating asteroseismic radius and mass inferences. By combining radial velocity (RV) measurements and photometric time series of eclipses, it is possible to determine the masses and radii of each component of a double-lined spectroscopic binary. We report the results of a four-year RV survey performed with the {\'e}chelle spectrometer of the Astrophysical Research Consortium's 3.5 m telescope and the APOGEE spectrometer at Apache Point Observatory. We compare the masses and radii of 10 red giants (RGs) obtained by combining radial velocities and eclipse photometry with the estimates from the asteroseismic scaling relations. We find that the asteroseismic scaling relations overestimate RG radii by about 5\% on average and masses by about 15\% for stars at various stages of RG evolution. Systematic overestimation of mass leads to underestimation of stellar age, which can have important implications for ensemble asteroseismology used for Galactic studies. As part of a second objective, where asteroseismology is used for understanding binary systems, we confirm that oscillations of RGs in close binaries can be suppressed enough to be undetectable, ahypothesis that was proposed in a previous work.},

For the {$\alpha$}-enhanced models, we adopt [{$\alpha$}/Fe] = 0.2 and 0.4. For the evolved subgiant KIC 7976303 with mixed modes, the {$\alpha$}-enhanced models fit the observations better than the models without {$\alpha$}-enhancement, and point to a star with M = 1.20 {$\pm$} 0.02 M , t = 4.88 {$\pm$} 0.08 Gyr, R = 2.04 {$\pm$} 0.01 R and L = 5.07 {$\pm$} 0.05 L . For the post turn-off star KIC 8694723, we find that the models fit the observations well in all three cases ([{$\alpha$}/Fe] = 0.0, 0.2 and 0.4). According to the observed metal abundances, only {$\alpha$}-enhanced models are used to estimate the stellar parameters, which are M = 1.13 {$\pm$} 0.06 M , t = 5.47 {$\pm$} 0.43 Gyr, R = 1.55 {$\pm$} 0.13 R and L = 3.18 {$\pm$} 0.26 L . Our {$\alpha$}-enhanced models indicate that KIC 7976303 has a larger mass and younger age than in previous works based on standard models. Furthermore, the differences of estimated mass and age between the three cases are {$\sim$}0.1 M and {$\sim$}0.5\textendash{}1.3 Gyr. These results suggest that we include {$\alpha$}-enhancement in the modelling of {$\alpha$}-enhanced stars, such as members of globular clusters and metal-poor stars in the disc and in the halo.},

  volume = {616},
  issn = {0004-6361, 1432-0746},
  abstract = {Methods. We compute stretched spectra that mimic the regular pattern of pure dipole gravity modes. Mixed modes with the same azimuthal order are expected to be almost equally spaced in stretched period, with a spacing equal to the pure dipole gravity mode period spacing. The departure from this regular pattern allows us to disentangle the various rotational components and therefore to determine the mean core rotation rates of red giants.
Results. We automatically identify the rotational multiplet components of 1183 stars on the red giant branch with a success rate of 69\% with respect to our initial sample. As no information on the internal rotation can be deduced for stars seen pole-on, we obtain mean core rotation measurements for 875 red giant branch stars. This large sample includes stars with a mass as large as 2.5 M , allowing us to test the dependence of the core slow-down rate on the stellar mass.
Conclusions. Disentangling rotational splittings from mixed modes is now possible in an automated way for stars on the red giant branch, even for the most complicated cases, where the rotational splittings exceed half the mixed-mode spacing. This work on a large sample allows us to refine previous measurements of the evolution of the mean core rotation on the red giant branch. Rather than a slight slow-down, our results suggest rotation is constant along the red giant branch, with values independent of the mass.},

The 12 exoplanets with radii {$<$}2.7 R{$\oplus$} and precise mass measurements appear to fall into two populations, with those {$<$}1.6 R{$\oplus$} following an Earth-like composition curve and larger planets requiring a significant fraction of volatiles.

The data returned from Kepler are unique in terms of the number of stars observed, precision of photometry for time series observations, and the temporal extent of high duty cycle observations. As the first mission to provide extensive time series measurements on thousands of stars over months to years at a level hitherto possible only for the Sun, the results from Kepler will vastly increase our knowledge of stellar variability for quiet solar-type stars. Here, we report on the stellar noise inferred on the timescale of a few hours of most interest for detection of exoplanets via transits. By design the data from moderately bright Kepler stars are expected to have roughly comparable levels of noise intrinsic to the stars and arising from a combination of fundamental limitations such as Poisson statistics and any instrument noise. The noise levels attained by Kepler on-orbit exceed by some 50\% the target levels for solar-type, quiet stars. We provide a decomposition of observed noise for an ensemble of 12th magnitude stars arising from fundamental terms (Poisson and readout noise), added noise due to the instrument and that intrinsic to the stars. The largest factor in the modestly higher than anticipated noise follows from intrinsic stellar noise. We show that using stellar parameters from galactic stellar synthesis models, and projections to stellar rotation, activity, and hence noise levels reproduce the primary intrinsic stellar noise features.},

Using non-adiabatic models and our capability to measure surface effects, we also investigate the dependency of these surface effects on the stellar parameters. Our results suggest a dependence of the magnitude of the surface effect on the mixing length parameter which also, but only minimally, affects the determination of stellar parameters.

  issn = {0035-8711, 1365-2966},
  abstract = {The masses and radii of solar-like oscillators can be estimated through the asteroseismic scaling relations. These relations provide a direct link between observables, i.e. effective temperature and characteristics of the oscillation spectra, and stellar properties, i.e. mean density and surface gravity (thus mass and radius). These scaling relations are commonly used to characterize large samples of stars. Usually, the Sun is used as a reference from which the structure is scaled. However, for stars that do not have a similar structure as the Sun, using the Sun as a reference introduces systematic errors as large as 10 per cent in mass and 5 per cent in radius. Several alternatives for the reference of the scaling relation involving the large frequency separation (typical frequency difference between modes of the same degree and consecutive radial order) have been suggested in the literature. In a previous paper, we presented a reference function with a dependence on both effective temperature and metallicity. The accuracy of predicted masses and radii improved considerably when using reference values calculated from our reference function. However, the residuals indicated that stars on the red giant branch possess a mass dependence that was not accounted for. Here, we present a reference function for the scaling relation involving the large frequency separation that includes the mass dependence.

  abstract = {We report the discovery of a post-mass-transfer Gamma Doradus/Delta Scuti hybrid pulsator in the eclipsing binary KIC9592855. This binary has a circular orbit, an orbital period of 1.2 days, and contains two stars of almost identical masses (M1 = 1.72 M, M2 = 1.71 M). However, the cooler secondary star is more evolved (R2 = 1.96 R), while the hotter primary is still on the zero-age-main-sequence (R1 = 1.53 R). Coeval models from single-star evolution cannot explain the observed masses and radii, and binary evolution with mass-transfer needs to be invoked. After subtracting the binary light curve, the Fourier spectrum shows low-order pressure-mode pulsations, and more dominantly, a cluster of low-frequency gravity modes at about 2 day-1. These g-modes are nearly equally spaced in period, and the period spacing pattern has a negative slope. We identify these g-modes as prograde dipole modes and find that they stem from the secondary star. The frequency range of unstable p-modes also agrees with that of the secondary. We derive the internal rotation rate of the convective core and the asymptotic period spacing from the observed g-modes. The resulting values suggest that the core and envelope rotate nearly uniformly, i.e., their rotation rates are both similar to the orbital frequency of this synchronized binary.},

The primary and secondary components of KIC 4544587 reside within the {$\delta$} Scuti and {$\gamma$} Dor instability region of the Hertzsprung\textendash{}Russell diagram, respectively. By applying the binary modelling software PHOEBE to prewhitened Kepler photometric data and radial velocity data obtained using the William Herschel Telescope and 4-m Mayall telescope at Kitt Peak Northern Observatory (KPNO), the fundamental parameters of this important system have been determined, including the stellar masses, 1.98 {$\pm$}0.07 and 1.60 {$\pm$} 0.06 M , and radii, 1.76 {$\pm$} 0.03 and 1.42 {$\pm$} 0.02 R , for the primary and secondary components, respectively. Frequency analysis of the residual data revealed 31 modes, 14 in the gravity mode region and 17 in the pressure mode region. Of the 14 gravity modes, 8 are orbital harmonics: a signature of tidal resonance. While the measured amplitude of these modes may be partially attributed to residual signal from binary model subtraction, we demonstrate through consideration of the folded light curve that these frequencies do in fact correspond to tidally excited pulsations. Furthermore, we present an echelle diagram of the pressure mode frequency region (modulo the orbital frequency) and demonstrate that the tides are also influencing the p modes. A first look at asteroseismology hints that the secondary component is responsible for the p modes, which is contrary to our expectation that the hotter star should pulsate in higher radial overtone, higher frequency p modes.},

The analysis combines Kepler light curves with follow-up spectroscopic data from the Keck telescope, KPNO (Kitt Peak National Observatory) 4-m Mayall telescope and the 2.7-m telescope at the McDonald observatory. We apply the binary modelling software, PHOEBE, to the Kepler light curve and radial velocity data to determine a detailed binary star model that includes the prominent pulsation and Doppler boosting, alongside the usual attributes of a binary star model (including tidal distortion and reflection). The results show that the system contains a slightly evolved F star with an M secondary companion in a highly eccentric orbit (e = 0.886). We use the results of the binary star model in a companion paper (Fuller) where we show that the prominent pulsation can be explained by a tidally excited oscillation mode held near resonance by a resonance locking mechanism.},

  abstract = {We present an extensive peakbagging effort on Kepler data of {$\sim$}50 red giant stars in the open star cluster NGC 6819. By employing sophisticated pre-processing of the time series and Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques we extracted individual frequencies, heights and line widths for hundreds of oscillation modes. We show that the `average' asteroseismic parameter {$\delta\nu$}02, derived from these, can be used to distinguish the stellar evolutionary state between the red giant branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars. Masses and radii are estimated using asteroseismic scaling relations, both empirically corrected to obtain self-consistency and agreement with independent measures of distance, and using updated theoretical corrections. Remarkable agreement is found, allowing the evolutionary state of the giants to be determined exclusively from the empirical correction to the scaling relations. We find a mean mass of the RGB stars and RC stars in NGC 6819 to be 1.61 {$\pm$} 0.02 and 1.64 {$\pm$} 0.02 M , respectively. The difference M = -0.03 {$\pm$} 0.01 M is almost insensitive to systematics, suggesting very little RGB mass loss, if any. Stars that are outliers relative to the ensemble reveal overmassive members that likely evolved via mass transfer in a blue straggler phase. We suggest that KIC 4937011, a low-mass Li-rich giant, is a cluster member in the RC phase that experienced very high mass loss during its evolution. Such over- and undermassive stars need to be considered when studying field giants, since the true age of such stars cannot be known and there is currently no way to distinguish them from normal stars.},

  abstract = {One of the tasks of the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Operations Center (KASOC) is to provide asteroseismic analyses on Kepler Objects of Interest. However, asteroseismic analysis of planetary host stars presents some unique complications with respect to data pre-processing, compared to pure asteroseismic targets. If not accounted for, the presence of planetary transits in the photometric time series often greatly complicates or even hinders these asteroseismic analyses. This drives the need for specialized methods of pre-processing data to make them suitable for asteroseismic analysis. In this paper, we present the KASOC filter, which is used to automatically prepare data from the Kepler/K2 mission for asteroseismic analyses of solarlike planet host stars. The methods are very effective at removing unwanted signals of both instrumental and planetary origins and produce significantly cleaner photometric time series than the original data. The methods are automated and can therefore easily be applied to a large number of stars. The application of the filter is not restricted to planetary hosts, but can be applied to any solar-like or red giant stars observed by Kepler/K2.},

Since AGB variability has a typical timescale on the order of a year, we discuss at length the removal of long-term trends and quarterly changes in Kepler data. Photometry for a small sample of nine semi-regular (SR) AGB stars is examined using a 30 minute cadence over a period of 45 months. While undergoing long-period variations of many magnitudes, the light curves are shown to be smooth at the millimagnitude level over much shorter time intervals. No flares or other rapid events were detected on a sub-day timescale. The shortest AGB period detected is on the order of 100 days. All the SR variables in our sample are shown to have multiple modes. This is always the first overtone, typically combined with the fundamental. A second common characteristic of SR variables is shown to be the simultaneous excitation of multiple closely separated periods for the same overtone mode. Approximately half the sample had a much longer variation in the light curve, likely a long secondary period (LSP). The light curves were all well represented by a combination of sinusoids. However, the properties of the sinusoids are time variable, with irregular variations present at low levels. No non-radial pulsations were detected. It is argued that the LSP variation seen in many SR variables is intrinsic to the star and linked to multiple mode pulsation.},

Results. We find that the mass has significant influence on the asteroseismic quantities {$\Delta\nu$} vs. {$\nu$}max relation, while the influence of metallicity is negligible, under the assumption that the metallicity does not affect the excitation/damping of the oscillations. The positions of the stars in the H-R diagram depend on both mass and metallicity. Furthermore, the stellar masses derived for the field stars are bracketed by those of the cluster stars.
Conclusions. Both the mass and metallicity contribute to the observed difference in locations in the H-R diagram of the old metal-rich cluster NGC 6791 and the middle-aged solar-metallicity cluster NGC 6819. For the young cluster NGC 6811, the explanation of the position of the stars in the H-R diagram challenges the assumption of solar metallicity, and this open cluster might have significantly lower metallicity [Fe/H] in the range -0.3 to -0.7 dex. Also, nearly all the observed field stars seem to be older than NGC 6811 and younger than NGC 6791.},

  abstract = {Methods. We use published methods to derive {$\nu$}max and {$\Delta\nu$} for timeseries ranging from 50 to 600 days and compare these results as a function of method, timespan and {$\Delta\nu$} .
Results. We find that in general a minimum of the order of 400 day long timeseries are necessary to obtain reliable results for the global oscillation parameters in more than 95\% of the stars, but this does depend on {$\Delta\nu$} . In a statistical sense the quoted uncertainties seem to provide a reasonable indication of the precision of the obtained results in short (50-day) runs, they do however seem to be overestimated for results of longer runs. Furthermore, the different definitions of the global parameters used in the different methods have non-negligible effects on the obtained values. Additionally, we show that there is a correlation between {$\nu$}max and the flux variance.
Conclusions. We conclude that longer timeseries improve the likelihood to detect oscillations with automated codes (from {$\sim$}60\% in 50 day runs to {$>$}95\% in 400 day runs with a slight method dependence) and the precision of the obtained global oscillation parameters. The trends suggest that the improvement will continue for even longer timeseries than the 600 days considered here, with a reduction in the median absolute deviation of more than a factor of 10 for an increase in timespan from 50 to 2000 days (the currently foreseen length of the mission). This work shows that global parameters determined with high precision \textendash{} thus from long datasets \textendash{}using different definitions can be used to identify the evolutionary state of the stars.},

The independent log(g) value from asteroseismology can be used as a fixed value in the spectroscopic analysis to reduce uncertainties because log(g) and effective temperature cannot be determined independently from spectra. Since 2012, a combined analysis of seismically and spectroscopically derived stellar properties has been ongoing for a large survey with SDSS/APOGEE and Kepler. Therefore, knowledge of any potential biases and uncertainties in asteroseismic log(g) values is now becoming important.},

  abstract = {Methods. We implement an alternative mathematical description compared to what is used in the literature to analyse observational data and to extract the underlying physical parameters that determine the frequencies of mixed modes. This description takes the radial order of the modes explicitly into account, which reduces its sensitivity to aliases. Additionally, and for the first time, this method allows us to constrain the gravity mode offset g for red-giant stars.
Results. We find that this alternative mathematical description allows us to determine the period spacing {$\increment\Pi$} and the coupling term q for the dipole modes within a few percent of values found in the literature. Additionally, we find that g varies on a star-by-star basis and should not be kept fixed in the analysis. Furthermore, we find that the coupling factor is logarithmically related to the physical width of the evanescent region normalised by the radius at which the evanescent zone is located. Finally, the local density contrast at the edge of the core of red-giant branch models shows a tentative correlation with the offset g.
Conclusions. We are continuing to exploit the full potential of the mixed modes to investigate the internal structures of red-giant stars; in this case we focus on the evanescent zone. It remains, however, important to perform comparisons between observations and models with great care as the methods employed are sensitive to the range of input frequencies.},

We performed the radial velocity (RV) measurement of the system with the Subaru 8.2 m telescope on UT 2012 August 10, covering a complete transit of KOI-94.01 for {$\sim$}6.7 hr. The resulting RV variation due to the RM effect spectroscopically confirms that KOI-94.01 is indeed the transiting planet and implies that its orbital axis is well aligned with the stellar spin axis; the projected spin\textendash{}orbit angle {$\lambda$} is estimated as -6+-1131 deg. This is the first measurement of the RM effect for a multiple transiting system. Remarkably, the archived Kepler light curve around BJD = 2455211.5 (date in UT 2010 January 14/15) indicates a ``double-transit'' event of KOI-94.01 and KOI94.03, in which the two planets transit the stellar disk simultaneously. Moreover, the two planets partially overlap with each other, and exhibit a ``planet\textendash{}planet eclipse'' around the transit center. This provides a rare opportunity to put tight constraints on the configuration of the two transiting planets by joint analysis with our Subaru RM measurement. Indeed, we find that the projected mutual inclination of KOI-94.01 and KOI-94.03 is estimated to be {$\delta$} = -1{$\smwhtcircle$}.15 {$\pm$} 0{$\smwhtcircle$}.55. Implications for the migration model of multiple planet systems are also discussed.},

  abstract = {We present a global analysis of KOI-977, one of the planet host candidates detected by Kepler. The Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) reports that KOI-977 is a red giant, for which few close-in planets have been discovered. Our global analysis involves spectroscopic and asteroseismic determinations of stellar parameters (e.g., mass and radius) and radial velocity (RV) measurements. Our analyses reveal that KOI-977 is indeed a red giant, possibly in the red clump, but its estimated radius ( 20 R = 0.093 AU) is much larger than KOI-977.01's orbital distance ({$\sim$}0.027 AU) estimated from its period (Porb {$\sim$} 1.35 days) and host star's mass. RV measurements show a small variation, which also contradicts the amplitude of ellipsoidal variations seen in the light curve folded with KOI-977.01's period. Therefore, we conclude that KOI-977.01 is a false positive, meaning that the red giant, for which we measured the radius and RVs, is different from the object that produces the transit-like signal (i.e., an eclipsing binary). On the basis of this assumption, we also perform a light curve analysis including the modeling of transits/eclipses and phase-curve variations, adopting various values for the dilution factor D, which is defined as the flux ratio between the red giant and eclipsing binary. Fitting the whole folded light curve as well as individual transits in the short cadence data simultaneously, we find that the estimated mass and radius ratios of the eclipsing binary are consistent with those of a solar-type star and a late-type star (e.g., an M dwarf) for D 20.},

  abstract = {The physical parameters of the retired A star HD 185351 were analysed in great detail by Johnson et al. using interferometry, spectroscopy, and asteroseismology. Results from all independent methods are consistent with HD 185351 having a mass in excess of 1.5 M . However, the study also showed that not all observational constraints could be reconciled in stellar evolutionary models, leading to mass estimates ranging from {$\sim$}1.6 to 1.9 M and casting doubts on the accuracy of stellar properties determined from asteroseismology. Here, we solve this discrepancy and construct a theoretical model in agreement with all observational constraints on the physical parameters of HD 185351. The effects of varying input physics are examined as well as the additional constraint of the observed g-mode period spacing is considered. This quantity is found to be sensitive to the inclusion of additional mixing from the convective core during the main sequence, and can be used to calibrate the overshooting efficiency using low-luminosity red giant stars. A theoretical model with metallicity [Fe/H] = 0.16 dex, mixing-length parameter {$\alpha$}MLT = 2.00, and convective overshooting efficiency parameter f = 0.030 is found to be in complete agreement with all observational constraints for a stellar mass of M 1.60 M .},

The object shows a high-frequency pulsation at 181.7324 d-1 (P = 7.9 min) with an amplitude of 1.45 mmag, and low-frequency rotational modulation corresponding to a period of 20.4339 d with an amplitude of 7.64 mmag. Spectral analysis confirms the Ap nature of the target, with characteristic lines of Eu II, Nd III and Pr III present. The spectra are not greatly affected by broadening, which is consistent with the long rotational period found from photometry. From our spectral observations we derive a lower limit on the mean magnetic field modulus of B = 3.05 {$\pm$} 0.23 kG. Long cadence Kepler observations show a frequency quintuplet split by the rotational period of the star, typical for an oblique pulsator. We suggest the star is a quadrupole pulsator with a geometry such that i {$\sim$} 66{$\smwhtcircle$} and {$\beta$} {$\sim$} 33{$\smwhtcircle$}. We detect frequency variations of the pulsation in both the WASP and Kepler data sets on many time-scales. Linear, non-adiabatic stability modelling allows us to constrain a region on the Hertzsprung\textendash{}Russell diagram where the pulsations are unstable, an area consistent with observations.},

  abstract = {Time-resolved photometry of tens of thousands of red giant stars from space missions like Kepler and K2 has created the need for automated asteroseismic analysis methods. The first and most fundamental step in such analysis is to identify which stars show oscillations. It is critical that this step be performed with no, or little, detection bias, particularly when performing subsequent ensemble analyses that aim to compare the properties of observed stellar populations with those from galactic models. However, an efficient, automated solution to this initial detection step still has not been found, meaning that expert visual inspection of data from each star is required to obtain the highest level of detections. Hence, to mimic how an expert eye analyzes the data, we use supervised deep learning to not only detect oscillations in red giants, but also to predict the location of the frequency at maximum power, {$\nu$}max, by observing features in 2D images of power spectra. By training on Kepler data, we benchmark our deep-learning classifier against K2 data that are given detections by the expert eye, achieving a detection accuracy of 98\% on K2 Campaign 6 stars and a detection accuracy of 99\% on K2 Campaign 3 stars. We further find that the estimated uncertainty of our deep-learning-based {$\nu$}max predictions is about 5\%. This is comparable to human-level performance using visual inspection. When examining outliers, we find that the deep-learning results are more likely to provide robust {$\nu$}max estimates than the classical model-fitting method.},

Pulsating stars in eclipsing binary systems are particularly valuable since fundamental properties such as radii and masses can then be determined using two independent techniques. Furthermore, independently measured properties from binary orbits can be used to improve asteroseismic modelling for pulsating stars in which mode identifications are not straightforward.

  abstract = {We have studied solar-like oscillations in {$\sim$}800 red giant stars using Kepler long-cadence photometry. The sample includes stars ranging in evolution from the lower part of the red giant branch to the helium main sequence. We investigate the relation between the large frequency separation ({$\Delta\nu$}) and the frequency of maximum power ({$\nu$}max) and show that it is different for red giants than for main-sequence stars, which is consistent with evolutionary models and scaling relations. The distributions of {$\nu$}max and {$\Delta\nu$} are in qualitative agreement with a simple stellar population model of the Kepler field, including the first evidence for a secondary clump population characterized by M 2 M and {$\nu$}max 40\textendash{}110 {$\mu$}Hz. We measured the small frequency separations {$\delta\nu$}02 and {$\delta\nu$}01 in over 400 stars and {$\delta\nu$}03 in over 40. We present C-D diagrams for l = 1, 2, and 3 and show that the frequency separation ratios {$\delta\nu$}02/{$\Delta\nu$} and {$\delta\nu$}01/{$\Delta\nu$} have opposite trends as a function of {$\Delta\nu$}. The data show a narrowing of the l = 1 ridge toward lower {$\nu$}max, in agreement with models predicting more efficient mode trapping in stars with higher luminosity. We investigate the offset in the asymptotic relation and find a clear correlation with {$\Delta\nu$}, demonstrating that it is related to fundamental stellar parameters. Finally, we present the first amplitude\textendash{$\nu$}max relation for Kepler red giants. We observe a lack of low-amplitude stars for {$\nu$}max 110 {$\mu$}Hz and find that, for a given {$\nu$}max between 40 and 110 {$\mu$}Hz, stars with lower {$\Delta\nu$} (and consequently higher mass) tend to show lower amplitudes than stars with higher {$\Delta\nu$}.},

  abstract = {We have analyzed solar-like oscillations in {$\sim$}1700 stars observed by the Kepler Mission, spanning from the main sequence to the red clump. Using evolutionary models, we test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequency of maximum power ({$\nu$}max), the large frequency separation ({$\Delta\nu$}), and oscillation amplitudes. We show that the difference of the {$\Delta\nu$}\textendash{$\nu$}max relation for unevolved and evolved stars can be explained by different distributions in effective temperature and stellar mass, in agreement with what is expected from scaling relations. For oscillation amplitudes, we show that neither (L/M)s scaling nor the revised scaling relation by Kjeldsen \& Bedding is accurate for red-giant stars, and demonstrate that a revised scaling relation with a separate luminosity-mass dependence can be used to calculate amplitudes from the main sequence to red giants to a precision of {$\sim$}25\%. The residuals show an offset particularly for unevolved stars, suggesting that an additional physical dependency is necessary to fully reproduce the observed amplitudes. We investigate correlations between amplitudes and stellar activity, and find evidence that the effect of amplitude suppression is most pronounced for subgiant stars. Finally, we test the location of the cool edge of the instability strip in the Hertzsprung\textendash{}Russell diagram using solar-like oscillations and find the detections in the hottest stars compatible with a domain of hybrid stochastically excited and opacity driven pulsation.},

By combining interferometric angular diameters, Hipparcos parallaxes, asteroseismic densities, bolometric fluxes, and high-resolution spectroscopy, we derive a full set of near-model-independent fundamental properties for the sample. We first use these properties to test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequency of maximum power ({$\nu$}max) and the large frequency separation ({$\Delta\nu$}). We find excellent agreement within the observational uncertainties, and empirically show that simple estimates of asteroseismic radii for main-sequence stars are accurate to 4\%. We furthermore find good agreement of our measured effective temperatures with spectroscopic and photometric estimates with mean deviations for stars between Teff = 4600\textendash{}6200 K of -22 {$\pm$} 32 K (with a scatter of 97 K) and -58 {$\pm$} 31 K (with a scatter of 93 K), respectively.

  abstract = {We have used asteroseismology to determine fundamental properties for 66 Kepler planet-candidate host stars, with typical uncertainties of 3\% and 7\% in radius and mass, respectively. The results include new asteroseismic solutions for four host stars with confirmed planets (Kepler-4, Kepler-14, Kepler-23 and Kepler-25) and increase the total number of Kepler host stars with asteroseismic solutions to 77. A comparison with stellar properties in the planet-candidate catalog by Batalha et al. shows that radii for subgiants and giants obtained from spectroscopic follow-up are systematically too low by up to a factor of 1.5, while the properties for unevolved stars are in good agreement. We furthermore apply asteroseismology to confirm that a large majority of cool main-sequence hosts are indeed dwarfs and not misclassified giants. Using the revised stellar properties, we recalculate the radii for 107 planet candidates in our sample, and comment on candidates for which the radii change from a previously giant-planet/brown-dwarf/stellar regime to a sub-Jupiter size or vice versa. A comparison of stellar densities from asteroseismology with densities derived from transit models in Batalha et al. assuming circular orbits shows significant disagreement for more than half of the sample due to systematics in the modeled impact parameters or due to planet candidates that may be in eccentric orbits. Finally, we investigate tentative correlations between host-star masses and planet-candidate radii, orbital periods, and multiplicity, but caution that these results may be influenced by the small sample size and detection biases.},

The catalog is based on a compilation of literature values for atmospheric properties (temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity) derived from different observational techniques (photometry, spectroscopy, asteroseismology, and exoplanet transits), which were then homogeneously fitted to a grid of Dartmouth stellar isochrones. We use broadband photometry and asteroseismology to characterize 11,532 Kepler targets which were previously unclassified in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). We report the detection of oscillations in 2762 of these targets, classifying them as giant stars and increasing the number of known oscillating giant stars observed by Kepler by {$\sim$}20\% to a total of {$\sim$}15,500 stars. Typical uncertainties in derived radii and masses are {$\sim$}40\% and {$\sim$}20\%, respectively, for stars with photometric constraints only, and 5\%\textendash{}15\% and {$\sim$}10\% for stars based on spectroscopy and/or asteroseismology, although these uncertainties vary strongly with spectral type and luminosity class. A comparison with the Q1\textendash{}Q12 catalog shows a systematic decrease in radii of M dwarfs, while radii for K dwarfs decrease or increase depending on the Q1\textendash{}Q12 provenance (KIC or Yonsei\textendash{}Yale isochrones). Radii of F\textendash{}G dwarfs are on average unchanged, with the exception of newly identified giants. The Q1\textendash{}Q16 star properties catalog is a first step toward an improved characterization of all Kepler targets to support planet-occurrence studies.},

Stars with signatures exceeding 7.1{$\sigma$} are subjected to a suite of statistical tests including an examination of each star's centroid motion to reject false positives caused by background eclipsing binaries. Physical parameters for each planetary candidate are fitted to the transit signature, and signatures of additional transiting planets are sought in the residual light curve.

  abstract = {We have analyzed oscillations of the red giant star HD 186355 observed by the NASA Kepler satellite. The data consist of the first five quarters of science operations of Kepler, which cover about 13 months. The high-precision time-series data allow us to accurately extract the oscillation frequencies from the power spectrum. We find that the frequency of the maximum oscillation power, {$\nu$}max, and the mean large frequency separation, {$\Delta\nu$}, are around 106 and 9.4 {$\mu$}Hz, respectively. A regular pattern of radial and non-radial oscillation modes is identified by stacking the power spectra in an echelle diagram. We use the scaling relations of {$\Delta\nu$} and {$\nu$}max to estimate the preliminary asteroseismic mass, which is confirmed with the modeling result (M = 1.45 {$\pm$} 0.05 M ) using the Yale Rotating stellar Evolution Code (YREC7). In addition, we constrain the effective temperature, luminosity, and radius from comparisons between observational constraints and models. A number of mixed l = 1 modes are also detected and taken into account in our model comparisons. We find a mean observational period spacing for these mixed modes of about 58 s, suggesting that this red giant branch star is in the shell hydrogen-burning phase.},

  abstract = {Mixed modes have been extensively observed in post-main-sequence stars by the Kepler and CoRoT space missions. The mixture of the p and g modes can be measured by the dimensionless coefficient q, the so-called coupling strength factor. In this paper, we discuss the utility of the phase shifts \texttheta{} from the eigenvalue condition for mixed modes as a tool to characterize dipolar mixed modes from the theoretical as well as the practical point of view. Unlike the coupling strength, whose variation in a given star is very small over the relevant frequency range, the phase shifts vary significantly for different modes. The analysis in terms of \texttheta{} can also provide a better understanding of the pressure and gravity radial order for a given mixed mode. Observed frequencies of the Kepler red-giant star KIC 3744043 are used to test the method. The results are very promising.},

  abstract = {Gravito-acoustic modes in the Sun and other stars propagate in resonant cavities with a frequency below a given limit known as the cut-off frequency. At higher frequencies, waves are no longer trapped in the stellar interior and become traveller waves. In this article, we study six pulsating solar-like stars at different evolutionary stages observed by the NASA Kepler mission. These high signal-tonoise targets show a peak structure that extends at very high frequencies and are good candidates for studying the transition region between the modes and interference peaks or pseudo-modes. Following the same methodology successfully applied on Sun-as-a-star measurements, we uncover the existence of pseudo-modes in these stars with one or two dominant interference patterns depending on the evolutionary stage of the star. We also infer their cut-off frequency as the midpoint between the last eigenmode and the first peak of the interference patterns. Using ray theory we show that, while the period of one of the interference patterns is very close to half the large separation, the period of the other interference pattern depends on the time phase of mixed waves, thus carrying additional information on the stellar structure and evolution.},

  abstract = {We report the discovery of a new exceptional young lithium-rich giant, KIC 9821622, in the Kepler field that exhibits an unusually large enhancement of {$\alpha$}, Fe-peak, and r-process elements. From high-resolution spectra obtained with GRACES at Gemini North, we derived fundamental parameters and detailed chemical abundances of 23 elements from equivalent widths and synthesis analysis. By combining atmospheric stellar parameters with available asteroseismic data, we obtained the stellar mass, radius, and age. The data analysis reveals that KIC 9821622 is a Li-rich (A(Li)NLTE = 1.80 {$\pm$} 0.2) intermediate-mass giant star (M = 1.64 M ) located at the red giant branch near the luminosity bump. We find unexpectedly elevated abundances of Fe-peak and r-process elements. In addition, as previously reported, we find that this is a young star (2.37 Gyr) with unusually high abundances of {$\alpha$}-elements ([{$\alpha$}/Fe] = 0.31). The evolutionary status of KIC 9821622 suggests that its Li-rich nature is the result of internal fresh Li that is synthesized through the Cameron-Fowler mechanism near the luminosity bump. However, its peculiar enhancement of {$\alpha$}, Fe-peak, and r-process elements opens the possibility of external contamination by material enriched by a supernova explosion. Although it is less likely, planet accretion cannot be ruled out.},

We took new measurements of the radial velocities in a sample of 26 stars from APOKASC, including 13 ``young'' stars and 13 ``old'' stars with similar stellar parameters but with masses below 1.2 M and found that more of the young stars appear to be in binary systems with respect to the old stars. Furthermore, we show that the young stars do not follow the expected trend of [C/H] ratios versus mass for individual stars. However, with a population synthesis of low-mass stars including binary evolution and mass transfer, we can reproduce the observed [C/N] ratios versus mass. Our study shows how asteroseismology of solar-type red giants provides us with a unique opportunity to study the evolution of field blue stragglers after they have left the main-sequence.},

Asteroseismic oscillations detected in the Kepler short-cadence photometry combined with an effective temperature calculated from the interferometric angular diameter and bolometric flux yield a mean density {$\rho$} = 0.0130 {$\pm$} 0.0003 {$\rho$} and surface gravity log g = 3.280 {$\pm$} 0.011. Combining the gravity and density we find R = 5.35 {$\pm$} 0.20 R and M = 1.99 {$\pm$} 0.23 M . The trigonometric parallax and CHARA angular diameter give a radius R = 4.97 {$\pm$} 0.07 R . This smaller radius, when combined with the mean stellar density, corresponds to a stellar mass 1.60 {$\pm$} 0.08 M , which is smaller than the asteroseismic mass by 1.6{$\sigma$} . We find that a larger mass is supported by the observation of mixed modes in our high-precision photometry, the spacing of which is consistent only for M 1.8 M . Our various and independent mass measurements can be compared to the mass measured from interpolating the spectroscopic parameters onto stellar evolution models, which yields a model-based mass M ,model = 1.87 {$\pm$} 0.07 M . This mass agrees well with the asteroseismic value, but is 2.6{$\sigma$} higher than the mass from the combination of asteroseismology and interferometry. The discrepancy motivates future studies with a larger sample of giant stars. However, all of our mass measurements are consistent with HD 185351 having a mass in excess of 1.5 M .},

  abstract = {We present a new method for replacing the outermost layers of stellar models with interpolated atmospheres based on results from 3D simulations, in order to correct for structural inadequacies of these layers. This replacement is known as patching. Tests, based on 3D atmospheres from three different codes and interior models with different input physics, are performed. Using solar models, we investigate how different patching criteria affect the eigenfrequencies. These criteria include the depth, at which the replacement is performed, the quantity, on which the replacement is based, and the mismatch in Teff and log g between the un-patched model and patched 3D atmosphere. We find the eigenfrequencies to be unaltered by the patching depth deep within the adiabatic region, while changing the patching quantity or the employed atmosphere grid leads to frequency shifts that may exceed 1 {$\mu$}Hz. Likewise, the eigenfrequencies are sensitive to mismatches in Teff or log g. A thorough investigation of the accuracy of a new scheme, for interpolating mean 3D stratifications within the atmosphere grids, is furthermore performed. Throughout large parts of the atmosphere grids, our interpolation scheme yields sufficiently accurate results for the purpose of asteroseismology. We apply our procedure in asteroseismic analyses of four Kepler stars and draw the same conclusions as in the solar case: Correcting for structural deficiencies lowers the eigenfrequencies, this correction is slightly sensitive to the patching criteria, and the remaining frequency discrepancy between models and observations is less frequency dependent. Our work shows the applicability and relevance of patching in asteroseismology.},

  abstract = {Methods. We use a probabilistic method to compare different approaches to extracting the granulation signal. We fit the power density spectra of a large set of Kepler targets, determine the granulation and global oscillation parameter, and quantify scaling relations between them.
Results. We establish that a depression in power at about {$\nu$}max/2, known from the Sun and a few other main-sequence stars, is also statistically significant in red giants and that a super-Lorentzian function with two components is best suited to reproducing the granulation signal in the broader vicinity of the pulsation power excess. We also establish that the specific choice of the background model can affect the determination of {$\nu$}max, introducing systematic uncertainties that can significantly exceed the random uncertainties. We find the characteristic frequency (i.e., inverse timescale) and amplitude of both background components to tightly scale with {$\nu$}max for a wide variety of stars (about 2\textendash{}2000 {$\mu$}Hz in {$\nu$}max), and quantify a mass dependency of the latter. To enable comparison with theoretical predictions (which do not include the observed power depression), we computed effective timescales and bolometric intensity fluctuations and found them to approximately scale as {$\tau$}eff {$\propto$} g-0.85 T -0.4 and Agran {$\propto$} (g2 M)-1/4 (or more conveniently R/M3/4), respectively. Similarly, the bolometric pulsation amplitude scales approximately as Apuls {$\propto$} (g2 M)-1/3 (or R4/3/M), which implicitly verifies a separate mass and luminosity dependence of Apuls. We have also checked our scaling relations with solar reference values and find them in good agreement.
Conclusions. We provide a thorough analysis of the granulation background signal in a large sample of stars, from which we establish a unified model that allows us to accurately extract the granulation and global oscillation parameter. The resulting scaling relations allow a simple estimate of the overall spectral shape of any solar-type oscillator and might serve as a starting point for future largesample studies or as a reference for theoretical modelling of granulation.},

Results. We re-examine the global oscillation parameters of the giants in the binary systems in order to determine their seismic fundamental parameters and we find them to agree with the dynamic parameters from the literature if we adopt non-linear scalings. We note that a curvature and glitch corrected {$\increment\nu$}cor should be preferred over a local or average value of {$\increment\nu$}.

  abstract = {Advances in asteroseismology of solar-like stars now provide a unique method to estimate the stellar inclination i . This enables to evaluate the spin\textendash{}orbit angle of transiting planetary systems in a complementary fashion to the Rossiter\textendash{}McLaughlin effect, a well-established method to estimate the projected spin\textendash{}orbit angle {$\lambda$}. Although the asteroseismic method has been broadly applied to the Kepler data, its reliability is yet to be assessed intensively. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of i from asteroseismology of solar-like stars using 3000 simulated power spectra. We find that the low-signal-to-noise ratio of the power spectra induces a systematic underestimate (overestimate) bias for stars with high (low) inclinations. We derive analytical criteria for the reliable asteroseismic estimate, which indicates that reliable measurements are possible in the range of 20{$\smwhtcircle$} i 80{$\smwhtcircle$} only for stars with high-signal-tonoise ratio. We also analyse and measure the stellar inclination of 94 Kepler main-sequence solar-like stars, among that 33 are planetary hosts. According to our reliability criteria, a third of them (nine with planets, 22 without) have accurate stellar inclination. Comparison of our asteroseismic estimate of vsin i against spectroscopic measurements indicates that the latter suffers from a large uncertainty possibly due to the modelling of macroturbulence, especially for stars with projected rotation speed vsin i 5 km s-1. This reinforces earlier claims, and the stellar inclination estimated from the combination of measurements from spectroscopy and photometric variation for slowly rotating stars needs to be interpreted with caution.},

The temporal variability of the signatures attributed to granulation, faculae, and p-mode oscillations was analyzed and the analysis indicates a periodic variability in the granulation and faculae signatures\textemdash{}comparable to what is seen in the Sun.},

These 20 stars were selected based on their asteroseismic properties to sample the parameter space (effective temperature, surface gravity, activity level, etc.) around the Sun. Though the ultimate goal is to improve stellar dynamo models, we focus the present paper on the combination of space-based and ground-based observations that can be used to test the age\textendash{}rotation\textendash{}activity relations. In this paper we describe the considerations behind the selection of these 20 Sun-like stars and present an initial asteroseismic analysis, which includes stellar age estimates. We also describe the observations from the Nordic Optical Telescope and present mean values of measured excess fluxes. These measurements are combined with estimates of the rotation periods obtained from a simple analysis of the modulation in photometric observations from Kepler caused by starspots, and asteroseismic determinations of stellar ages, to test relations between age, rotation and activity.},

The main cause for such a relation would likely be enhanced dynamo action induced by the planet. We present measurements of chromospheric emission in 234 planet candidate systems from the Kepler mission. This ensemble includes 37 systems with giant-planet candidates, which show a clear emission enhancement. The enhancement, however, disappears when systems that are also identified as eclipsing binary candidates are removed from the ensemble. This suggests that a large fraction of the giant-planet candidate systems with chromospheric emission stronger than the Sun are not giant-planet systems, but false positives. Such false-positive systems could be tidally interacting binaries with strong chromospheric emission. This hypothesis is supported by an analysis of 188 eclipsing binary candidates that show increasing chromospheric emission as function of decreasing orbital period.},

It also shows one periodicity at a period of 3165 s. If this periodicity is a high-order g-mode, then this star may be the hottest member of the hybrid DW Lyn stars. In addition to the resolved pulsation frequencies, additional periodic variations in the light curve suggest that a significant number of additional pulsation frequencies may be present. The long duration of the run, the extremely high duty cycle and the well-behaved noise properties allow us to explore the stability of the periodic variations, and to place strong constraints on how many of them are independent stellar oscillation modes. We find that most of the identified periodicities are indeed stable in phase and amplitude, suggesting a rotation period of 2\textendash{}3 weeks for this star, but further observations are needed to confirm this suspicion.},

We present our analysis of two sdB stars that are found to be g-mode pulsators of the V1093 Her class. These two stars also display the distinct irradiation effect typical of sdB stars with a close M-dwarf companion with orbital periods of less than half a day. Because the orbital period is so short, the stars should be in synchronous rotation, and if so, the rotation period should imprint itself on the multiplet structure of the pulsations. However, we do not find clear evidence for such rotational splitting. Though the stars do show some frequency spacings that are consistent with synchronous rotation, they also display multiplets with splittings that are much smaller. Longer-duration time series photometry will be needed to determine if those small splittings are in fact rotational splitting, or caused by slow amplitude or phase modulation. Further data should also improve the signal-to-noise ratio, perhaps revealing lower-amplitude periodicities that could confirm the expectation of synchronous rotation. The pulsation periods seen in these stars show period spacings that are suggestive of high-overtone g-mode pulsations.},

We present an analysis of the g modes, which is complicated by the fact that the two sets of = 1 modes partially overlap in the frequency spectrum. Nevertheless, it is possible to disentangle them by identifying rotationally split doublets from one component and triplets from the other. The identification is helped by the presence of additive combination frequencies in the spectrum that involve the doublets but not the triplets. The rotational splittings of the multiplets imply core rotation periods of about 11 and 7 d in the two stars. One of the stars also shows evidence of = 2 modes.},

Results. For 23 of the 24 investigated stars, we find significant frequency shifts in time. We present evidence for magnetic activity in six of these stars. We find that the amplitude of the frequency shifts decreases with stellar age and rotation period. For KIC 8006161 (the most prominent example), we find that frequency shifts are smallest for the lowest and largest for the highest p-mode frequencies, as they are for the Sun.
Conclusions. These findings show that magnetic activity can be routinely observed in the oscillation parameters for solar-like stars, which opens up the possibility of placing the solar activity cycle in the context of other stars by asteroseismology.},

  abstract = {We present a simple diagnostic that can be used to constrain the location of the differential rotation in red giants with measured mixed mode rotational splittings. Specifically, in red giants with radii {$\sim$}4 R , the splittings of p-dominated modes (sound wave-dominated) relative to those of g-dominated modes (internal gravity wave-dominated) are sensitive to how much of the differential rotation resides in the outer convection zone versus the radiative interior of the red giant. An independently measured surface rotation rate significantly aids breaking degeneracies in interpreting the measured splittings. We apply our results to existing observations of red giants, particularly those of Kepler-56, and find that most of the differential rotation resides in the radiative region rather than in the convection zone. This conclusion is consistent with results in the literature from rotational inversions, but our results are insensitive to some of the uncertainties in the inversion process and can be readily applied to large samples of red giants with even a modest number of measured rotational splittings. We argue that differential rotation in the radiative interior strongly suggests that angular momentum transport in red giants is dominated by local fluid instabilities rather than large-scale magnetic stresses.},

Besides being of great importance for our understanding of RR Lyrae stars in general, these RR Lyr data can be regarded as a case study for observations of bright stars with Kepler. Kepler can perform high-precision photometry on targets like RR Lyr, as the saturated flux is conserved to a very high degree. The Kepler data on RR Lyr are revolutionary in several respects. Even with long-cadence sampling (one measurement per 29.4 min), the unprecedented precision ({$<$} mmag) of the Kepler photometry allows the study of the star's extreme light-curve variations in detail. The multiplet structures at the main frequency and its harmonics, typical for Blazhko stars, are clearly detected up to the quintuplets. For the first time, photometric data of RR Lyr reveal the presence of half-integer frequencies, linked to a period-doubling effect. This phenomenon may be connected to the still unexplained Blazhko modulation. Moreover, with three observed Blazhko cycles at our disposal, we observe that there is no exact repetition in the light-curve changes from one modulation cycle to the next for RR Lyr. This may be due to additional periodicities in the star, or to transient or quasi-periodic changes.},

  abstract = {We have discovered a new rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) star among the Kepler mission target stars, KIC 10195926. This star shows two pulsation modes with periods that are amongst the longest known for roAp stars at 17.1 and 18.1 min, indicating that the star is near the terminal-age main sequence. The principal pulsation mode is an oblique dipole mode that shows a rotationally split frequency septuplet that provides information on the geometry of the mode. The secondary mode also appears to be a dipole mode with a rotationally split triplet, but we are able to show within the improved oblique pulsator model that these two modes cannot have the same axis of pulsation. This is the first time for any pulsating star that evidence has been found for separate pulsation axes for different modes. The two modes are separated in frequency by 55 {$\mu$}Hz, which we model as the large separation. The star is an {$\alpha$}2 CVn spotted magnetic variable that shows a complex rotational light variation with a period of Prot = 5.684 59 d. For the first time for any spotted magnetic star of the upper main sequence, we find clear evidence of light variation with a period of twice the rotation period, that is, a subharmonic frequency of {$\nu$}rot/2. We propose that this and other subharmonics are the first observed manifestation of torsional modes in an roAp star. From high-resolution spectra, we determine Teff = 7400 K, log g = 3.6 and v sin i = 21 km s-1. We have found a magnetic pulsation model with fundamental parameters close to these values that reproduces the rotational variations of the two obliquely pulsating modes with different pulsation axes. The star shows overabundances of the rare earth elements, but these are not as extreme as most other roAp stars. The spectrum is variable with rotation, indicating surface abundance patches.},

The primary is a {$\delta$} Sct\textendash{$\gamma$} Dor star pulsating in both p modes and g modes. Using four years of Kepler Mission photometric data, we independently model the light curve using the traditional technique with the modelling code PHOEBE, and we study the orbital characteristics using the new frequency modulation technique. We show that both methods provide the equivalent orbital period, eccentricity and argument of periastron, thus illustrating and validating the FM technique. In the amplitude spectrum of the p-mode pulsations, we also discovered an FM signal compatible with a third body in the system, a low-mass M dwarf in an 861-d orbit around the primary pair. However, the eclipses show no timing variations, indicating that the FM signal is a consequence of the intrinsic change in pulsation frequency, thus providing a cautionary tale. Our analysis shows the potential of the FM technique using Kepler data, and we discuss the prospects to detect planets and brown dwarfs in Kepler data for A and F stars even in the absence of transits and with no spectroscopic radial velocity curves. This opens the possibility of finding planets orbiting hotter stars that cannot be found by traditional techniques.},

This gives the first robust determination of the rotation of the deep core and surface of a main-sequence star, essentially model independently. We find its rotation to be nearly uniform with a period near 100 d, but we show with high confidence that the surface rotates slightly faster than the core. A strong angular momentum transfer mechanism must be operating to produce the nearly rigid rotation, and a mechanism other than viscosity must be operating to produce a more rapidly rotating surface than core. Our asteroseismic result, along with previous asteroseismic constraints on internal rotation in some B stars, and measurements of internal rotation in some subgiant, giant and white dwarf stars, has made angular momentum transport in stars throughout their lifetimes an observational science.},

  abstract = {There are many Slowly Pulsating B (SPB) stars and {$\gamma$} Dor stars in the Kepler mission data set. The light curves of these pulsating stars have been classified phenomenologically into stars with symmetric light curves and with asymmetric light curves. In the same effective temperature ranges as the {$\gamma$} Dor and SPB stars, there are variable stars with downward light curves that have been conjectured to be caused by spots. Among these phenomenological classes of stars, some show `frequency groups' in their amplitude spectra that have not previously been understood. While it has been recognized that non-linear pulsation gives rise to combination frequencies in a Fourier description of the light curves of these stars, such combination frequencies have been considered to be a only a minor constituent of the amplitude spectra. In this paper, we unify the Fourier description of the light curves of these groups of stars, showing that many of them can be understood in terms of only a few base frequencies, which we attribute to g-mode pulsations, and combination frequencies, where sometimes a very large number of combination frequencies dominate the amplitude spectra. The frequency groups seen in these stars are thus tremendously simplified. We show observationally that the combination frequencies can have amplitudes greater than the base frequency amplitudes, and we show theoretically how this arises. Thus for some {$\gamma$} Dor and SPB stars, combination frequencies can have the highest observed amplitudes. Among the B stars are pulsating Be stars that show emission lines in their spectra from occasional ejection of material into a circumstellar disc. Our analysis gives strong support to the understanding of these pulsating Be stars as rapidly rotating SPB stars, explained entirely by g-mode pulsations.},

For a given {$\nu$}, 1 depends not only on the stellar mass, but also on mixing processes that can affect the structure of the core. We find that in the case of more evolved red-giant-branch stars and regardless of the transport processes occurring in their interiors, the observed 1 can provide information as to their stellar luminosity, within {$\sim$}10\textendash{}20 per cent.

  abstract = {We present the Kepler photometry of KIC 6048106, which is exhibiting the O'Connell effect and multiperiodic pulsations. Including a starspot on either of the components, light-curve synthesis indicates that this system is a semi-detached Algol with a mass ratio of 0.211, an orbital inclination of 73\textdegree. 9, and a large temperature difference of 2534 K. To examine in detail both the spot variations and pulsations, we separately analyzed the Kepler time-series data at the interval of an orbital period in an iterative way. The results reveal that the variable asymmetries of the light maxima can be interpreted as the changes with time of a magnetic cool spot on the secondary component. Multiple frequency analyses were performed in the outside-eclipse light residuals after removal of the binarity effects from the observed Kepler data. We detected 30 frequencies with signal to noise amplitude ratios larger than 4.0, of which six ( f2\textendash{}f6 and f10) can be identified as high-order (17n25) low-degree ({$\mathscr{l}$}=2) gravity-mode pulsations that were stable during the observing run of 200 days. In contrast, the other frequencies may be harmonic and combination terms. For the six frequencies, the pulsation periods and pulsation constants are in the ranges of 0.352\textendash{}0.506 days and 0.232\textendash{}0.333 days, respectively. These values and the position on the Hertzsprung\textendash{}Russell diagram demonstrate that the primary star is a {$\gamma$} Dor variable.

  abstract = {KIC 7177553 was observed by the Kepler satellite to be an eclipsing eccentric binary star system with an 18-day orbital period. Recently, an eclipse timing study of the Kepler binaries has revealed eclipse timing variations (ETVs) in this object with an amplitude of {$\sim$}100 sand an outer period of 529 days. The implied mass of the third body is that of a super-Jupiter, but below the mass of a brown dwarf. We therefore embarked on a radial velocity (RV) study of this binary to determine its system configuration and to check the hypothesis that it hosts a giant planet. From the RV measurements, it became immediately obvious that the same Kepler target contains another eccentric binary, this one with a 16.5-day orbital period. Direct imaging using adaptive optics reveals that the two binaries are separated by 0 4 ({$\sim$}167 AU)and have nearly the same magnitude (to within 2\%). The close angular proximity of the two binariesand very similar {$\gamma$} velocitiesstrongly suggest that KIC 7177553 is one of the rare SB4 systems consisting of two eccentric binaries where at least one system is eclipsing. Both systems consist of slowly rotating, nonevolved, solar-like stars of comparable masses. From the orbital separation and the small difference in {$\gamma$} velocity, we infer that the period of the outer orbit most likely lies in the range of1000\textendash{}3000 yr. New images taken over the next few years, as well as the high-precision astrometry of the Gaia satellite mission, will allow us to set much narrower constraints on the system geometry. Finally, we note that the observed ETVs in the Kepler data cannot be produced by the second binary. Further spectroscopic observations on a longer timescale will be required to prove the existence of the massive planet.},

  abstract = {In {$\gamma$} Doradus stars, the g-mode period spacing shows an approximately linear relation with period. The slope is a new asteroseismic diagnostic, related to the rotation rate and the azimuthal order m. We report two automated methods, the `moving-window Fourier transform' and the `cross-correlation', to detect and measure the period spacings based on four-year light curves from the Kepler satellite. The results show that the cross-correlation method performs better at detecting the period spacings and their slopes. In this paper, we apply our method to 22 {$\gamma$} Dor stars with g-mode multiplets split by rotation. The rotation periods are similar to the g-mode period spacings, causing the multiplets to overlap. To clarify the overlapping patterns, we use the \textasciiacute{}echelle diagram and introduce a `copy-shift' diagram to discern and measure the splittings. The first observational relation between slopes and splittings is shown. The slope deviates from zero when the splitting increases, as the theory predicts. We found that what appears to be rotational splittings in two stars is in fact caused by two nearly-identical overlapping patterns from binaries.},

  abstract = {Methods. We analysed Kepler photometry to 1) re-calculate transit parameters; 2) study the light-curve modulations; and 3) to perform an asteroseismic analysis (accurate stellar parameter determination) by identifying solar-like oscillations on the periodogram. We also used a high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum obtained with the Calar Alto Fiber-fed {\'E}chelle spectrograph (CAFE) to measure stellar properties. Additionally, false-positive scenarios were rejected by obtaining high-resolution images with the AstraLux lucky imaging camera on the 2.2 m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory.
Results. We confirm the planetary nature of the object transiting the star Kepler-91 by deriving a mass of Mp = 0.88-+00..3137 MJup and a planetary radius of Rp = 1.384-+00..005141 RJup. Asteroseismic analysis produces a stellar radius of R = 6.30 {$\pm$} 0.16 R and a mass of M = 1.31 {$\pm$} 0.10 M . We find that its eccentric orbit (e = 0.066-+00..001173) is just 1.32-+00..2027 R away from the stellar atmosphere at the pericentre. We also detected three small dims in the phase-folded light curve. The combination of two of them agrees with the theoretical characteristics expected for secondary eclipse.
Conclusions. Kepler-91b could be the previous stage of the planet engulfment, which has recently been detected for BD+48 740. Our estimations show that Kepler-91b will be swallowed by its host star in less than 55 Myr. Among the confirmed planets around giant stars, this is the closest to its host star. At pericentre, the star subtends an angle of 48{$\smwhtcircle$}, covering around 10\% of the sky as seen from the planet. The planetary atmosphere seems to be inflated probably due to the high stellar irradiation.},

We discuss the properties of these systems in terms of their formation and evolution off the main sequence. Interestingly, we find that 70.0 {$\pm$} 6.6\% of the planets in this regime are inner components of multiplanetary systems. This value is 4.2{$\sigma$} higher than for main-sequence hosts, which we find to be 42.4 {$\pm$} 0.1\%. The properties of the known planets seem to indicate that the closest-in planets (a {$<$} 0.06 au) to main-sequence stars are massive (i.e., hot Jupiters) and isolated and that they are subsequently engulfed by their host as it evolves to the red giant branch, leaving only the predominant population of multiplanetary systems in orbits 0.06 {$<$} a {$<$} 0.5 au. We discuss the implications of this emerging observational trend in the context of formation and evolution of hot Jupiters.},

  abstract = {Dramatically improved data from observatories like the CoRoT and Kepler spacecraft have recently facilitated nonlinear time series analysis and phenomenological modeling of variable stars, including the search for strange (aka fractal) or chaotic dynamics. We recently argued [Lindner et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114 (2015) 054101] that the Kepler data includes ``golden'' stars, whose luminosities vary quasiperiodically with two frequencies nearly in the golden ratio, and whose secondary frequencies exhibit power-law scaling with exponent near -1.5, suggesting strange nonchaotic dynamics and singular spectra. Here we use a series of phenomenological models to make plausible the connection between golden stars and fractal spectra. We thereby suggest that at least some features of variable star dynamics reflect universal nonlinear phenomena common to even simple systems.},

When modelling the SONG target {$\mathrm{\mu}$} Herculis, we found that the age determination constrained by individual oscillation frequencies of this subgiant is not sensitive to the changes of model input parameters (i.e., helium, heavy elements, and the mixing-length parameters). The studies of model dependences of stellar ages were then carried out on 36 Kepler subgiants. And we found that the changes in model input helium fraction and the mixing-length parameter do not systematically affect the age estimates. For the subgiants with good measurements of their metallicities, accurate ages can be expected. If assuming the uncertainties in Yinit and {$\alpha$}MLT are {$\pm$}0.02 and {$\pm$}0.2. Then the average age precision of our sample based on asteroseismic modelling would be around 10\%.},

High-quality observations of eclipsing binary stars observed by Kepler offer a great opportunity to calibrate model parameters for evolved stars. Our study focuses on six Kepler red giants with the goal of calibrating the mixing-length parameter of convection as well as the asteroseismic surface term in models. We introduce a new method to improve the identification of oscillation modes that exploits theoretical frequencies to guide the mode identification (`peak-bagging') stage of the data analysis. Our results indicate that the convective mixing-length parameter ({$\alpha$}) is {$\approx$}14 per cent larger for red giants than for the Sun, in agreement with recent results from modelling the APOGEE stars. We found that the asteroseismic surface term (i.e. the frequency offset between the observed and predicted modes) correlates with stellar parameters (Teff, log g) and the mixing-length parameter. This frequency offset generally decreases as giants evolve. The two coefficients a-1 and a3 for the inverse and cubic terms that have been used to describe the surface term correction are found to correlate linearly. The effect of the surface term is also seen in the p\textendash{}g mixed modes; however, established methods for correcting the effect are not able to properly correct the g-dominated modes in late evolved stars.},

The extraction of seismic information includes two parts. First, we obtained two global asteroseismic parameters, mean large separation {$\increment\nu$} and frequency of maximum power {$\nu$}max, with autocorrelation function and collapsed autocorrelation function. Second, we extracted individual oscillation modes {$\nu$}nl with low-l degree using a least-squares fit. Stellar grid models were built with Yale Rotating Stellar Evolution Code (YREC) to analyze stellar properties. They covered the range of M = 0.8 {$\sim$} 1.8 M{$\odot$} with a step of 0.02 M{$\odot$} and [Fe/H] = -0.3 {$\sim$} 0.4 dex with a step of 0.1 dex. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate stellar fundamental parameters of the six stars, under the constraints of asteroseismic parameters ({$\increment\nu$}, {$\nu$}max) and non-asteroseismic parameters (Teff, [Fe/H]). We discover that the six targets include five sub-giant stars with 1.2 {$\sim$} 1.5 M{$\odot$} and one main-sequence star with 1.08 M{$\odot$}, and with ages in the range of 3 {$\sim$} 5 Gyr.},

We use Kepler short-cadence data, of which each star has at least 12 months, to create frequency-power spectra optimized for asteroseismology. For each star, we identify its modes of oscillation and extract parameters such as frequency, amplitude, and line width using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo ``peak-bagging'' approach. We report the extracted mode parameters for all 66 stars, as well as derived quantities such as frequency difference ratios, the large and small separations Dn and dn02; the behavior of line widths with frequency and line widths at nmax with Teff, for which we derive parametrizations; and behavior of mode visibilities. These average properties can be applied in future peak-bagging exercises to better constrain the parameters of the stellar oscillation spectra. The frequencies and frequency ratios can tightly constrain the fundamental parameters of these solar-type stars, and mode line widths and amplitudes can test models of mode damping and excitation.},

These figures are made from a grid of stellar evolutionary models that cover masses ranging from 0.7 M to 1.6 M in steps of 0.1 M and metallicities in the interval -0.3 dex {$\leq$} [Fe/H] {$\leq$} +0.3 dex in increments of 0.1 dex. The stellar evolutionary models are computed using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code with simple input physics.
Results. We have compared the results from AME with results for three groups of stars: stars with radii determined from interferometry (and measured parallaxes), stars with radii determined from measurements of their parallaxes (and calculated angular diameters), and stars with results based on modelling their individual oscillation frequencies. We find that a comparison of the radii from interferometry to those from AME yields a weighted mean of the fractional differences of just 2\%. This is also the level of deviation that we find when we compare the parallax-based radii to the radii determined from AME.
Conclusions. The comparison between independently determined stellar parameters and those found using AME show that our method can provide reliable stellar masses, radii, and ages, with median uncertainties in the order of 4\%, 2\%, and 25\%, respectively.},

KIC 3858884 is a bright Kepler target whose light curve shows deep eclipses, complex pulsation patterns with pulsation frequencies typical of {$\delta$} Sct, and a highly eccentric orbit. We present the result of the analysis of Kepler photometry and of high resolution phaseresolved spectroscopy. Spectroscopy yielded both the radial velocity curves and, after spectral disentangling, the primary-component effective temperature and metallicity, and line-of-sight projected rotational velocities. The Kepler light curve was analyzed with an iterative procedure that was devised to disentangle eclipses from pulsations and takes the visibility of the pulsating star into account during eclipses. The search for the best set of binary parameters was performed by combining the synthetic light curve models with a genetic minimization algorithm, which yielded a robust and accurate determination of the system parameters. The binary components have very similar masses (1.88 and 1.86 M ) and effective temperatures (6800 and 6600 K), but different radii (3.45 and 3.05 R ). The comparison with the theoretical models showed a somewhat different evolutionary status of the components and the need to introduce overshooting in the models. The pulsation analysis indicates the hybrid nature of the pulsating (secondary) component, where the corresponding high order g-modes might be excited by an intrinsic mechanism or by tidal forces.},

We obtain medium-resolution visible spectra of 382 stars with KP - J {$>$} 2 ( K5 and later spectral type). We determine luminosity class by comparing the strength of gravity-sensitive indices (CaH, K i, Ca ii, and Na i) to their strength in a sample of stars of known luminosity class. We find that giants constitute 96\% {$\pm$} 1\% of the bright (KP {$<$} 14) Kepler target stars, and 7\% {$\pm$} 3\% of dim (KP {$>$} 14) stars, significantly higher than fractions based on the stellar parameters quoted in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). The KIC effective temperatures are systematically (110+-1355 K) higher than temperatures we determine from fitting our spectra to PHOENIX stellar models. Through Monte Carlo simulations of the Kepler exoplanet candidate population, we find a planet occurrence of 0.36 {$\pm$} 0.08 when giant stars are properly removed, somewhat higher than when a KIC log g {$>$} 4 criterion is used (0.27 {$\pm$} 0.05). Last, we show that there is no significant difference in g - r color (a probe of metallicity) between late-type Kepler stars with transiting Earth-to-Neptune-size exoplanet candidates and dwarf stars with no detected transits. We show that a previous claimed offset between these two populations is most likely an artifact of including a large number of misidentified giants.},

Based on an analysis of the Kepler brightness measurements, along with high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy, Doppler spectroscopy, and (for 11 stars) asteroseismology, we establish low false-positive probabilities (FPPs) for all of the transiting planets (41 of 42 have an FPP under 1\%), and we constrain their sizes and masses. Most of the transiting planets are smaller than three times the size of Earth. For 16 planets, the Doppler signal was securely detected, providing a direct measurement of the planet's mass. For the other 26 planets we provide either marginal mass measurements or upper limits to their masses and densities; in many cases we can rule out a rocky composition. We identify six planets with densities above 5 g cm-3, suggesting a mostly rocky interior for them. Indeed, the only planets that are compatible with a purely rocky composition are smaller than {$\sim$}2 R{$\oplus$}. Larger planets evidently contain a larger fraction of low-density material (H, He, and H2O).},

  abstract = {We show that the masses of red giant stars can be well predicted from their photospheric carbon and nitrogen abundances, in conjunction with their spectroscopic stellar labels log g, Teff, and [Fe/H]. This is qualitatively expected from mass-dependent post-main-sequence evolution. We here establish an empirical relation between these quantities by drawing on 1475 red giants with asteroseismic mass estimates from Kepler that also have spectroscopic labels from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) DR12. We assess the accuracy of our model, and find that it predicts stellar masses with fractional rms errors of about 14 per cent (typically 0.2 M ). From these masses, we derive ages with rms errors of 40 per cent. This empirical model allows us for the first time to make age determinations (in the range 1\textendash{}13 Gyr) for vast numbers of giant stars across the Galaxy. We apply our model to {$\sim$}52 000 stars in APOGEE DR12, for which no direct mass and age information was previously available. We find that these estimates highlight the vertical age structure of the Milky Way disc, and that the relation of age with [{$\alpha$}/M] and metallicity is broadly consistent with established expectations based on detailed studies of the solar neighbourhood.},

  abstract = {Methods. We used the APOKASC sample to analyse the dependencies of the log g discrepancy as a function of stellar mass and stellar evolutionary status. We discuss and study the impact of some neglected abundances on spectral analysis of red giants, such as He and carbon isotopic ratio.
Results. We first show that, for stars at the bottom of the red giant branch where the first dredge-up had occurred, the discrepancy between spectroscopic log g and asteroseismic log g depends on stellar mass. This seems to indicate that the log g discrepancy is related to CN cycling. Among the CN-cycled elements, we demonstrate that the carbon isotopic ratio (12C/13C) has the largest impact on stellar spectrum. In parallel, we observe that this log g discrepancy shows a similar trend as the 12C/13C ratios as expected by stellar evolution theory. Although we did not detect a direct spectroscopic signature of 13C, other corroborating evidences suggest that the discrepancy in log g is tightly correlated to the production of 13C in red giants. Moreover, by running the data-driven algorithm (the Cannon) on a synthetic grid trained on the APOGEE data, we try to evaluate more quantitatively the impact of various 12C/13C ratios.
Conclusions. While we have demonstrated that 13C indeed impacts all parameters, the size of the impact is smaller than the observed offset in log g. If further tests confirm that 13C is not the main element responsible of the log g problem, the number of spectroscopic effects remaining to be investigated is now relatively limited (if any).},

We estimate global parameters of the acoustic (p) modes such as the average large and small frequency separations, the frequency of the maximum of the p-mode envelope, and the average line width of the acoustic modes. We were able to identify and to measure 22 p-mode frequencies for the first star and 16 for the second one even though the S/N of these stars are rather low. We also derive some information about the stellar rotation periods from the analyses of the low-frequency parts of the power spectral densities. A model-independent estimation of the mean density, mass, and radius is obtained using the scaling laws. We emphasize the importance of continued observations for the stars with low S/N for an improved characterization of the oscillation modes. Our results offer a preview of what will be possible for many stars with the long data sets obtained during the remainder of the mission.},

We perform a uniform analysis of 22 of the brightest asteroseismic targets with the highest signalto-noise ratio observed for 1 month each during the first year of the mission, and we quantify the precision and relative accuracy of asteroseismic determinations of the stellar radius, mass, and age that are possible using various methods. We present the properties of each star in the sample derived from an automated analysis of the individual oscillation frequencies and other observational constraints using the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal (AMP), and we compare them to the results of model-grid-based methods that fit the global oscillation properties. We find that fitting the individual frequencies typically yields asteroseismic radii and masses to {$\sim$}1\% precision, and ages to {$\sim$}2.5\% precision (respectively, 2, 5, and 8 times better than fitting the global oscillation properties). The absolute level of agreement between the results from different approaches is also encouraging, with model-grid-based methods yielding slightly smaller estimates of the radius and mass and slightly older values for the stellar age relative to AMP, which computes a large number of dedicated models for each star.

  abstract = {Asteroseismology has proven to be an excellent tool to determine not only global stellar properties with good precision, but also to infer the stellar structure, dynamics, and evolution for a large sample of Kepler stars. Prior to the launch of the mission, the properties of Kepler targets were inferred from broadband photometry, leading to the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). The KIC was later revised in the Kepler Star Properties Catalog, based on literature values and an asteroseismic analysis of stars that were unclassified in the KIC. Here, we present an asteroseismic analysis of 45,400 stars that were classified as dwarfs in the Kepler Star Properties Catalog. We found that around 2\% of the sample shows acoustic modes in the typical frequency range that put them in the red-giant category rather than the cool dwarf category. We analyze the asteroseismic properties of these stars, derive their surface gravities, masses, and radii, and present updated effective temperatures and distances. We show that the sample is significantly fainter than the previously known oscillating giants in the Kepler field, with the faintest stars reaching down to a Kepler magnitude of Kp {$\sim$} 16. We demonstrate that 404 stars are at distances beyond 5 kpc and that the stars are significantly less massive than for the original Kepler red-giant sample, consistent with a population of distant halo giants. A comparison with a galactic population model shows that up to 40 stars might be genuine halo giants, which would increase the number of known asteroseismic halo stars by a factor of 4. The detections presented here will provide a valuable sample for galactic archeology studies.},

We present revised stellar properties for 197,096 Kepler targets observed between Quarters 1\textendash{}17 (Q1-17), which were used for the final transiting planet search run by the Kepler Mission (Data Release 25, DR25). Similar to the Q1\textendash{}16 catalog by Huber et al., the classifications are based on conditioning published atmospheric parameters on a grid of Dartmouth isochrones, with significant improvements in the adopted method and over 29,000 new sources for temperatures, surface gravities, or metallicities. In addition to fundamental stellar properties, the new catalog also includes distances and extinctions, and we provide posterior samples for each stellar parameter of each star. Typical uncertainties are {$\sim$}27\% in radius, {$\sim$}17\% in mass, and {$\sim$}51\% in density, which is somewhat smaller than previous catalogs because of the larger number of improved log g constraints and the inclusion of isochrone weighting when deriving stellar posterior distributions. On average, the catalog includes a significantly larger number of evolved solar-type stars, with an increase of 43.5\% in the number of subgiants.

We find that the fraction of stars with variability greater than that of the Sun is 60\%, which is marginally consistent with previous studies, and confirm the trend of increasing variability with decreasing effective temperatures. We define low and high variability samples, with a cut corresponding to twice the variability level of the active Sun, and compare the properties of the stars belonging to each sample. We show tentative evidence that the more active stars have lower proper motions and may be located closer to the galactic plane. We also investigate the frequency content of the variability, finding clear evidence for periodic or quasi-periodic behaviour in 16\% of stars, and showing that there exist significant differences in the nature of variability between spectral types. Of the periodic objects, most A and F stars have short periods ({$<$}2 days) and highly sinusoidal variability, suggestive of pulsations, whilst G, K and M stars tend to have longer periods ({$>$}5 days, with a trend towards longer periods at later spectral types) and show a mixture of periodic and stochastic variability, indicative of activity. Finally, we use auto-regressive models to characterise the stochastic component of the variability, and show that its typical amplitude and time-scale both increase towards later spectral types, which we interpret as a corresponding increase in the characteristic size and life-time of active regions.},

Chaplin et al. published observations of three bright G-type stars, which were monitored during the first 33.5 days of science operations. One of these stars, the subgiant KIC 11026764, exhibits a characteristic pattern of oscillation frequencies suggesting that it has evolved significantly. We have derived asteroseismic estimates of the properties of KIC 11026764 from Kepler photometry combined with ground-based spectroscopic data. We present the results of detailed modeling for this star, employing a variety of independent codes and analyses that attempt to match the asteroseismic and spectroscopic constraints simultaneously. We determine both the radius and the age of KIC 11026764 with a precision near 1\%, and an accuracy near 2\% for the radius and 15\% for the age. Continued observations of this star promise to reveal additional oscillation frequencies that will further improve the determination of its fundamental properties.},

The orbital period of the binary system is too long to provide meaningful dynamical constraints on the stellar properties, but asteroseismology can help because the stars are among the brightest in the Kepler field. We present an analysis of three months of nearly uninterrupted photometry of 16 Cyg A and B from the Kepler space telescope. We extract a total of 46 and 41 oscillation frequencies for the two components, respectively, including a clear detection of octupole (l = 3) modes in both stars. We derive the properties of each star independently using the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal, fitting the individual oscillation frequencies and other observational constraints simultaneously. We evaluate the systematic uncertainties from an ensemble of results generated by a variety of stellar evolution codes and fitting methods. The optimal models derived by fitting each component individually yield a common age (t = 6.8 {$\pm$} 0.4 Gyr) and initial composition (Zi = 0.024 {$\pm$} 0.002, Yi = 0.25 {$\pm$} 0.01) within the uncertainties, as expected for the components of a binary system, bolstering our confidence in the reliability of asteroseismic techniques.

While only a few such data sets were available for detailed modeling just a decade ago, the Kepler mission has produced suitable observations for hundreds of new targets. This rapid expansion in observational capacity has been accompanied by a shift in analysis and modeling strategies to yield uniform sets of derived stellar properties more quickly and easily. We use previously published asteroseismic and spectroscopic data sets to provide a uniform analysis of 42 solar-type Kepler targets from the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal. We find that fitting the individual frequencies typically doubles the precision of the asteroseismic radius, mass, and age compared to grid-based modeling of the global oscillation properties, and improves the precision of the radius and mass by about a factor of three over empirical scaling relations. We demonstrate the utility of the derived properties with several applications.},

An analysis with the Asteroseismic Modeling Portal, using all of the available constraints to model each star independently, yields the same age (t = 7.0 {$\pm$} 0.3 Gyr) and composition (Z = 0.021 {$\pm$} 0.002, Yi = 0.25 {$\pm$} 0.01) for both stars, as expected for a binary system. We quantify the accuracy of the derived stellar properties by conducting a similar analysis of a Kepler-like data set for the Sun, and we investigate how the reliability of asteroseismic inference changes when fewer observational constraints are available or when different fitting methods are employed. We find that our estimates of the initial helium mass fraction are probably biased low by 0.02\textendash{}0.03 from neglecting diffusion and settling of heavy elements, and we identify changes to our fitting method as the likely source of small shifts from our initial results in 2012.

We compile published chromospheric activity measurements for the sample of Kepler asteroseismic targets that were used to establish the new rotation\textendash{}age relations. We use these data along with a sample of wellcharacterized solar analogs from the Mount Wilson HK survey to develop a qualitative scenario connecting the evolution of chromospheric activity to a fundamental shift in the character of differential rotation.

  abstract = {After decades of effort, the solar activity cycle is exceptionally well characterized, but it remains poorly understood. Pioneering work at the Mount Wilson Observatory demonstrated that other Sun-like stars also show regular activity cycles, and suggested two possible relationships between the rotation rate and the length of the cycle. Neither of these relationships correctly describes the properties of the Sun, a peculiarity that demands explanation. Recent discoveries have started to shed light on this issue, suggesting that the Sun's rotation rate and magnetic field are currently in a transitional phase that occurs in all middle-aged stars. Motivated by these developments, we identify the manifestation of this magnetic transition in the best available data on stellar cycles. We propose a reinterpretation of previously published observations to suggest that the solar cycle may be growing longer on stellar evolutionary timescales, and that the cycle might disappear sometime in the next 0.8 \textendash{} 2.4 Gyr. Future tests of this hypothesis will come from ground-based activity monitoring of Kepler targets that span the magnetic transition, and from asteroseismology with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission to determine precise masses and ages for bright stars with known cycles.},

Here, we make predictions of the numbers of systems that may be detectable in data already collected by the NASA Kepler Mission. Our predictions, which are based upon TRILEGAL and BiSEPS simulations of the Kepler field of view, indicate that as many as 200 or more ``asteroseismic binaries'' may be detectable in this manner. Most of these binaries should be comprised of two He-core-burning red giants. Owing largely to the limited numbers of targets with the requisite short-cadence Kepler data, we expect only a small number of detected binaries containing solar-type stars. The predicted yield of detections is sensitive to the assumed initial mass ratio distribution (IMRD) of the binary components and therefore represents a sensitive calibration of the much debated IMRD near mass ratio unity.},

We use the method of cross-correlation to measure the radial velocity (RV) of our targets, while atmospheric parameters are derived using the ROTFIT code and spectral synthesis method. We discover three double-lined spectroscopic binaries, HIP 94924, HIP 95115 and HIP 97321 \textendash{} for the last system, we provide the orbital solution, and we report two suspected single-lined spectroscopic binaries, HIP 94112 and HIP 96062. For all stars from our sample we derive RV, v sin i, Teff, log g and metallicity, and for six stars, we perform a detailed abundance analysis. A spectral classification is done for 33 targets. Finally, we show that the early-type star HIP 94472 is rotating slowly (v sin i = 13 km s-1) and we confirm its classification to the Am spectral type which makes it an interesting and promising target for asteroseismic modelling. The comparison of the results reported in this paper with the information in the Kepler Input Catalogue (KIC) shows an urgent need for verification and refinement of the atmospheric parameters listed in the KIC. That refinement is crucial for making a full use of the data delivered by Kepler and can be achieved only by a detailed ground-based study.},

  abstract = {The asteroseismic and planetary studies, like all research related to stars, need precise and accurate stellar atmospheric parameters as input. We aim at deriving the effective temperature (Teff), the surface gravity (log g), the metallicity ([Fe/H]), the projected rotational velocity (v sin i) and the MK type for 169 F-, G-, K- and M-type Kepler targets which were observed spectroscopically from the ground with five different instruments. We use two different spectroscopic methods to analyse 189 high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise spectra acquired for the 169 stars. For 67 stars, the spectroscopic atmospheric parameters are derived for the first time. KIC 9693187 and 11179629 are discovered to be double-lined spectroscopic binary systems. The results obtained for those stars for which independent determinations of the atmospheric parameters are available in the literature are used for a comparative analysis. As a result, we show that for solar-type stars the accuracy of present determinations of atmospheric parameters is {$\pm$}150 K in Teff, {$\pm$}0.15 dex in [Fe/H] and {$\pm$}0.3 dex in log g. Finally, we confirm that the curve-of-growth analysis and the method of spectral synthesis yield systematically different atmospheric parameters when they are applied to stars hotter than 6000 K.},

We obtain accurate relative photometry of KIC 8462852 from the Kepler full-frame images, finding that the brightness of KIC 8462852 monotonically decreased over the four years it was observed by Kepler. Over the first {$\sim$}1000 days KIC 8462852 faded approximately linearly at a rate of 0.341{$\pm$}0.041\% yr-1, for a total decline of 0.9\%. KIC 8462852 then dimmed much more rapidly in the next {$\sim$}200 days, with its flux dropping by more than 2\%. For the final {$\sim$}200 days of Kepler photometry the magnitude remained approximately constant, although the data are also consistent with the decline rate measured for the first 2.7 years. Of a sample of 193 nearby comparison stars and 355 stars with similar stellar parameters, none exhibit the rapid decline by {$>$}2\% or the cumulative fading by 3\% of KIC 8462852. Moreover, of these comparison stars, only one changes brightness as quickly as the 0.341\% yr-1 measured for KIC 8462852 during the first three years of the Kepler mission. We examine whether the rapid decline could be caused by a cloud of transiting circumstellar material, finding that while such a cloud could evade detection in submillimeter observations, the transit ingress and duration cannot be explained by a simple cloud model. Moreover, this model cannot account for the observed longer-term dimming. No known or proposed stellar phenomena can fully explain all aspects of the observed light curve.},

This long-term variability can be recovered in photometry from the full-frame images (FFIs), a set of calibration data collected approximately monthly during the Kepler mission. Here we present f3, an open-source package to perform photometry on the Kepler FFIs in order to detect changes in the brightness of stars in the Kepler field of view over long time baselines. We apply this package to a sample of 4000 Sun\textendash{}like stars with measured rotation periods. We find that {$\approx$}10\% of these targets have long-term variability in their observed flux. For the majority of targets, we find that the luminosity variations are either correlated or anticorrelated with the short-term variability due to starspots on the stellar surface. We find a transition between anticorrelated (starspotdominated) variability and correlated (facula-dominated) variability between rotation periods of 15 and 25 days, suggesting the transition between the two modes is complete for stars at the age of the Sun. We also identify a sample of stars with apparently complete cycles, as well as a collection of short-period binaries with extreme photometric variation over the Kepler mission.},

  abstract = {Methods. We pursued forward seismic modelling based on adiabatic eigenfrequencies of equilibrium models for eight extensive evolutionary grids tuned to KIC 10526294 by varying the initial mass, metallicity, chemical mixture, and the extent of the overshooting layer on top of the convective core. We examined models for both OP and OPAL opacities and tested the occurrence of extra diffusive mixing throughout the radiative interior.
Results. We find a tight mass-metallicity relation within the ranges M {$\in$} [3.13, 3.25] M and Z {$\in$} [0.014, 0.028]. We deduce that an exponentially decaying diffusive core overshooting prescription describes the seismic data better than a step function formulation and derive a value of fov between 0.017 and 0.018. Moreover, the inclusion of extra diffusive mixing with a value of log Dmix between 1.75 and 2.00 dex (with Dmix in cm2 s-1) improves the goodness-of-fit based on the observed and modelled frequencies by a factor {$\sim$}11 compared to the case where no extra mixing is considered, irrespective of the (M, Z) combination within the allowed seismic range.
Conclusions. The inclusion of diffusive mixing in addition to core overshooting is essential to explain the structure in the observed period spacing pattern of this star. Moreover, for the input physics and chemical mixtures we investigated, we deduce that an exponentially decaying prescription for the core overshooting is to be preferred over a step function, regardless of the adopted mixture or choice of opacity tables. Our best models for KIC 10526294 approach the seismic data to a level that they can serve future inversion of its stellar structure.},

  volume = {537},
  issn = {0004-6361, 1432-0746},
  abstract = {Methods. Various different methods were compared in order to validate the processes and to derive reliable output values. For consistency, a single method was then used to determine scaling relations for the relevant global asteroseismic parameters: mean mode height, mean height of the background signal superimposed on the oscillation power excess, width of the power excess, bolometric amplitude of the radial modes and visibility of non-radial modes. A method for deriving oscillation amplitudes is proposed, which relies on the complete identification of the red giant oscillation spectrum.
Results. The comparison of the different methods has shown the important role of the way the background is modelled. The convergence reached by the collaborative work enables us to derive significant results concerning the oscillation power excess. We obtain several scaling relations, and identify the influence of the stellar mass and the evolutionary status. The effect of helium burning on the red giant interior structure is confirmed: it yields a strong mass-radius relation for clump stars. We find that none of the amplitude scaling relations motivated by physical considerations predict the observed mode amplitudes of red giant stars. In parallel, the degreedependent mode visibility exhibits important variations. Both effects seem related to the significant influence of the high mode mass of non-radial mixed modes. A family of red giants with very weak dipole modes is identified, and its properties are analyzed.
Conclusions. The clear correlation between the power densities of the background signal and of the stellar oscillation induces important consequences to be considered for deriving a reliable theoretical relation of the mode amplitude. As a by-product of this work, we have verified that red giant asteroseismology delivers new insights for stellar and Galactic physics, given the evidence for mass loss at the tip of the red giant branch.},

  issn = {0004-6361, 1432-0746},
  abstract = {Methods. We propose two ways for describing the so-called mode bumping that affects the frequencies of the mixed modes. Firstly, a phenomenological approach is used to describe the main features of the mode bumping. Alternatively, a quasi-asymptotic mixed-mode relation provides a powerful link between seismic observations and the stellar interior structure. We used period {\'e}chelle diagrams to emphasize the detection of the gravity-dominated mixed modes.
Results. The asymptotic relation for mixed modes is confirmed. It allows us to measure the gravity-mode period spacings in more than two hundred red giant stars. The identification of the gravity-dominated mixed modes allows us to complete the identification of all major peaks in a red giant oscillation spectrum, with significant consequences for the true identification of = 3 modes, of = 2 mixed modes, for the mode widths and amplitudes, and for the = 1 rotational splittings.
Conclusions. The accurate measurement of the gravity-mode period spacing provides an effective probe of the inner, g-mode cavity. The derived value of the coupling coefficient between the cavities is different for red giant branch and clump stars. This provides a probe of the hydrogen-shell burning region that surrounds the helium core. Core contraction as red giants ascend the red giant branch can be explored using the variation of the gravity-mode spacing as a function of the mean large separation.},

  abstract = {Methods. We have developed a dedicated method for automated measurements of the rotational splittings in a large number of red giants. Ensemble asteroseismology, namely the examination of a large number of red giants at different stages of their evolution, allows us to derive global information on stellar evolution.
Results. We have measured rotational splittings in a sample of about 300 red giants. We have also shown that these splittings are dominated by the core rotation. Under the assumption that a linear analysis can provide the rotational splitting, we observe a small increase of the core rotation of stars ascending the red giant branch. Alternatively, an important slow down is observed for red-clump stars compared to the red giant branch. We also show that, at fixed stellar radius, the specific angular momentum increases with increasing stellar mass.
Conclusions. Ensemble asteroseismology indicates what has been indirectly suspected for a while: our interpretation of the observed rotational splittings leads to the conclusion that the mean core rotation significantly slows down during the red giant phase. The slowdown occurs in the last stages of the red giant branch. This spinning down explains, for instance, the long rotation periods measured in white dwarfs.},

  abstract = {Methods. The analysis is focused on radial modes. We use series of radial-mode frequencies in published analyses of stars with solarlike oscillations to compare the asymptotic and observational values of the large separation. This comparison relies on the proper use of the second-order asymptotic expansion.
Results. We propose a simple formulation to correct the observed value of the large separation and then derive its asymptotic counterpart. The measurement of the curvature of the radial ridges in the {\'e}chelle diagram provides the correcting factor. We prove that, apart from glitches due to stellar structure discontinuities, the asymptotic expansion is valid from main-sequence stars to red giants. Our model shows that the asymptotic offset is close to 1/4, as in the theoretical development, for low-mass, main-sequence stars, subgiants and red giants.
Conclusions. High-quality solar-like oscillation spectra derived from precise photometric measurements are definitely better described with the second-order asymptotic expansion. The second-order term is responsible for the curvature observed in the {\'e}chelle diagrams used for analyzing the oscillation spectra, and this curvature is responsible for the difference between the observed and asymptotic values of the large separation. Taking it into account yields a revision of the scaling relations, which provides more accurate asteroseismic estimates of the stellar mass and radius. After correction of the bias (6\% for the stellar radius and 3\% for the mass), the performance of the calibrated relation is about 4\% and 8\% for estimating, respectively, the stellar radius and the stellar mass for masses less than 1.3 M ; the accuracy is twice as bad for higher mass stars and red giants.},

  issn = {0004-6361, 1432-0746},
  abstract = {Methods. We first measured global oscillation parameters of evolved red giants observed with Kepler with the envelope autocorrelation function method. We then used an extended form of the universal red giant oscillation pattern, extrapolated to very low frequency, to fully identify their oscillations. The comparison with ground-based results was then used to express the period-luminosity relation as a relation between the large frequency separation and the stellar luminosity.
Results. From the link between red giant oscillations observed by Kepler and period-luminosity sequences, we have identified these relations in evolved red giants as radial and non-radial solar-like oscillations. We were able to expand scaling relations at very low frequency (periods as long as 100 days and large frequency separation less than 0.05 {$\mu$}Hz). This helped us identify the different sequences of period-luminosity relations, and allowed us to propose a calibration of the K magnitude with the observed large frequency separation.
Conclusions. Interpreting period-luminosity relations in red giants in terms of solar-like oscillations allows us to investigate the time series obtained from ground-based microlensing surveys with a firm physical basis. This can be done with an analytical expression that describes the low-frequency oscillation spectra. The different behavior of oscillations at low frequency, with frequency separations scaling only approximately with the square root of the mean stellar density, can be used to precisely address the physics of the semi-regular variables. This will allow improved distance measurements and opens the way to extragalactic asteroseismology with the observations of M giants in the Magellanic Clouds.},

Results. We measured the asymptotic period spacing for 1178 stars at various evolutionary stages.

We present clear quantified asteroseismic definitions that characterize the change in the evolutionary stages, in particular the transition from the subgiant stage to the early red giant branch, and the end of the horizontal branch.
Conclusions. The seismic information is so precise that clear conclusions can be drawn independently of evolution models. The quantitative seismic information can now be used for stellar modeling, especially for studying the energy transport in the heliumburning core or for specifying the inner properties of stars entering the red or asymptotic giant branches.

Results. Coupling factors of mixed modes were measured for thousands of red giants. They show specific variation with mass and evolutionary stage. Weak coupling is observed for the most evolved stars on the red giant branch only; large coupling factors are measured at the transition between subgiants and red giants as well as in the red clump.
Conclusions. The measurement of coupling factors in dipole mixed modes provides a new insight into the inner interior structure of evolved stars. While the large frequency separation and the asymptotic period spacings probe the envelope and core, respectively, the coupling factor is directly sensitive to the intermediate region in between and helps determine its extent. Observationally, the determination of the coupling factor is a prior to precise fits of the mixed-mode pattern and can now be used to address further properties of the mixed-mode pattern, such as the signature of buoyancy glitches and core rotation.},

  issn = {0004-6361, 1432-0746},
  abstract = {Methods. We perform a thorough characterization of the global seismic parameters of depressed dipole modes and show that these modes have a mixed character. The observation of stars showing dipole mixed modes that are depressed is especially useful for deriving model-independent conclusions on the dipole mode damping. We use a simple model to explain how mode visibilities are connected to the extra damping seen in depressed modes.
Results. Observations prove that depressed dipole modes in red giants are not pure pressure modes but mixed modes. This result, observed in more than 90\% of the bright stars (mV {$\leq$} 11), invalidates the hypothesis that depressed dipole modes result from the suppression of the oscillation in the radiative core of the stars. Observations also show that, except for visibility, seismic properties of the stars with depressed modes are equivalent to those of normal stars. The measurement of the extra damping that is responsible for the reduction of mode amplitudes, without any prior on its physical nature, potentially provides an efficient tool for elucidating the mechanism responsible for the mode depression.
Conclusions. The mixed nature of the depressed modes in red giants and their unperturbed global seismic parameters carry strong constraints on the physical mechanism responsible for the damping of the oscillation in the core. This mechanism is able to damp the oscillation in the core but cannot fully suppress it. Moreover, it cannot modify the radiative cavity probed by the gravity component of the mixed modes. The recent mechanism involving high magnetic fields proposed for explaining depressed modes is not compliant with the observations and cannot be used to infer the strength and prevalence of high magnetic fields in red giants.},

We seek to improve on this by the use of results from realistic and highly detailed 3D hydrodynamics simulations of stellar convection.

Our implementation also contains a non-constant mixing-length parameter, which varies as a function of the stellar surface gravity and temperature \textendash{} also derived from the 3D simulations. We give a detailed account of our fully consistent implementation and compare to earlier works, and also provide a freely available MESA-module. The evolution of low-mass stars with different masses is investigated, and we present for the first time an asteroseismic analysis of a standard solar model utilizing calibrated convection and temperature stratification from 3D simulations. We show that the inclusion of 3D results has an almost insignificant impact on the evolution and structure of stellar models \textendash{} the largest effect are changes in effective temperature of order 30 K seen in the pre-main sequence and in the red-giant branch.

  abstract = {Asteroseismology is witnessing a revolution, thanks to high-precise asteroseismic space data (MOST, COROT, Kepler, BRITE) and their large ground-based follow-up programs. Those instruments have provided an unprecedented large amount of information, which allows us to scrutinize its statistical properties in the quest for hidden relations among pulsational and/or physical observables. This approach might be particularly useful for stars whose pulsation content is difficult to interpret. This is the case of intermediate-mass classical pulsating stars (i.e. {$\gamma$} Dor, {$\delta$} Scuti, hybrids) for which current theories do not properly predict the observed oscillation spectra. Here, we establish a first step in finding such hidden relations from data mining techniques for these stars. We searched for those hidden relations in a sample of {$\delta$} Scuti and hybrid stars observed by COROT and Kepler (74 and 153, respectively). No significant correlations between pairs of observables were found. However, two statistically significant correlations emerged from multivariable correlations in the observed seismic data, which describe the total number of observed frequencies and the largest one, respectively. Moreover, three different sets of stars were found to cluster according to their frequency density distribution. Such sets are in apparent agreement with the asteroseismic properties commonly accepted for A-F pulsating stars.},

The latter observation indicates that Kepler data are not normally distributed. Moreover, a close inspection of the Pre-search Data Conditioned long-cadence data shows residuals that have increased noise on time-scales important to asteroseismology, but unimportant to planet searches.},

We present an analysis of 180 d of short-cadence Kepler photometry and of new spectroscopic data for this evolved, late A-type star. We infer from the 1150-d, long-cadence light curve, and in two different ways, that our target is the primary of a 343-d, non-eclipsing binary system.

The observed pulsations are modelled extensively, using separate, state-of-the-art, time-dependent convection (TDC) and rotating models. The models match the observed temperature and low metallicity, finding a mass of 1.50\textendash{}1.56 M . The models suggest that the whole star is metal poor, and that the low metallicity is not just a surface abundance peculiarity.

This produces a series of time-delay measurements in which binarity is apparent as a periodic modulation whose amplitude gives the projected light travel time across the orbit. Fourier analysis of this time-delay curve provides the parameters of the orbit, including the period, eccentricity, angle of ascending node, and time of periastron passage. Differentiating the time-delay curve yields the full radial-velocity curve directly from the Kepler photometry, without the need for spectroscopy. We show examples with {$\delta$} scuti stars having large numbers of pulsation modes, including one system in which both components of the binary are pulsating. The method is straightforward to automate, thus radial velocity curves can be derived for hundreds of non-eclipsing binary stars from Kepler photometry alone.},

Spectral classification and abundance analyses from high-resolution spectroscopy allow us to identify chemically peculiar stars, in which the absence of pulsations is not surprising. The remaining stars are chemically normal, yet they are not {$\delta$} Sct stars. Their lack of observed p modes cannot be explained through any known mechanism. However, they are mostly distributed around the edges of the {$\delta$} Sct instability strip, which allows for the possibility that they actually lie outside the strip once the uncertainties are taken into account. We investigated the possibility that the non-pulsators inside the instability strip could be unresolved binary systems, having components that both lie outside the instability strip. If misinterpreted as single stars, we found that such binaries could generate temperature discrepancies of {$\sim$}300 K \textendash{} larger than the spectroscopic uncertainties, and fully consistent with the observations. After these considerations, there remains one chemically normal nonpulsator that lies in the middle of the instability strip. This star is a challenge to pulsation theory. However, its existence as the only known star of its kind indicates that such stars are rare. We conclude that the {$\delta$} Sct instability strip is pure, unless pulsation is shut down by diffusion or another mechanism, which could be interaction with a binary companion.},

  abstract = {We explore the detection limits of the phase modulation (PM) method of finding binary systems among multiperiodic pulsating stars. The method is an attractive way of finding non-transiting planets in the habitable zones of intermediate-mass stars, whose rapid rotation inhibits detections via the radial velocity (RV) method. While oscillation amplitudes of a few mmag are required to find planets, many {$\delta$} Scuti stars have these amplitudes. In suboptimal cases where the signal to noise of the oscillations is lower, low-mass brown dwarfs ({$\sim$}13MJup) are detectable at orbital periods longer than about 1 yr, and the lowest mass main-sequence stars (0.1\textendash{}0.2 M ) are detectable at all orbital periods where the PM method can be applied. We use purpose-written Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) software for the calculation of the PM orbits, which offers robust uncertainties for comparison with RV solutions. Using Kepler data and ground-based RVs, we verify that these two methods are in agreement, even at short orbital periods where the PM method undersamples the orbit. We develop new theory to account for the undersampling of the time delays, which is also necessary for the inclusion of RVs as observational data in the MCMC software. We show that combining RVs with time delays substantially refines the orbits because of the complementarity of working in both the spatial (PM) and velocity (RV) domains simultaneously. Software outputs were tested through an extensive hare-and-hounds exercise, covering a wide range of orbital configurations including binaries containing two pulsators.},

We classify a sample of over 15 000 Kepler A and F stars into {$\delta$} Sct and non-{$\delta$} Sct stars, paying close attention to variability that could have other origins. We find that 18\% of Kepler {$\delta$} Sct stars have their dominant frequency above the Kepler long-cadence Nyquist frequency (periods {$<$} 1 hr), and 30\% have some superNyquist variability. We analyse the pulsator fraction as a function of effective temperature and luminosity, finding that many stars in the {$\delta$} Sct instability strip do not pulsate. The pulsator fraction peaks at just over 70\% in the middle of the instability strip. The results are insensitive to the amplitude threshold used to identify the pulsators. We define a new empirical instability strip based on the observed pulsator fraction that is systematically hotter than theoretical strips currently in use. The stellar temperatures, luminosities, and pulsation classifications are provided in an online catalogue.},

  abstract = {The orbital parameters of binaries at intermediate periods (102\textendash{}103 d) are difficult to measure with conventional methods and are very incomplete. We have undertaken a new survey, applying our pulsation timing method to Kepler light curves of 2224 main-sequence A/F stars and found 341 non-eclipsing binaries. We calculate the orbital parameters for 317 PB1 systems (single-pulsator binaries) and 24 PB2s (double-pulsators), tripling the number of intermediate-mass binaries with full orbital solutions. The method reaches down to small mass ratios q {$\approx$} 0.02 and yields a highly homogeneous sample. We parametrize the massratio distribution using both inversion and Markov-Chain Monte Carlo forward-modelling techniques, and find it to be skewed towards low-mass companions, peaking at q {$\approx$} 0.2. While solar-type primaries exhibit a brown dwarf desert across short and intermediate periods, we find a small but statistically significant (2.6{$\sigma$} ) population of extreme-mass-ratio companions (q {$<$} 0.1) to our intermediate-mass primaries. Across periods of 100\textendash{}1500 d and at q {$>$} 0.1, we measure the binary fraction of current A/F primaries to be 15.4 per cent {$\pm$} 1.4 per cent, though we find that a large fraction of the companions (21 per cent {$\pm$} 6 per cent) are white dwarfs in post-mass-transfer systems with primaries that are now blue stragglers, some of which are the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, barium stars, symbiotics, and related phenomena. Excluding these white dwarfs, we determine the binary fraction of original A/F primaries to be 13.9 per cent {$\pm$} 2.1 per cent over the same parameter space. Combining our measurements with those in the literature, we find the binary fraction across these periods is a constant 5 per cent for primaries M1 {$<$} 0.8 M , but then increases linearly with log M1, demonstrating that natal discs around more massive protostars M1 1 M become increasingly more prone to fragmentation. Finally, we find the eccentricity distribution of the main-sequence pairs to be much less eccentric than the thermal distribution.},

For each star, we extract the rotational frequency splitting and inclination angle from separate mode sets (adjacent modes with l = 2, 0, and 1) spanning the p-mode envelope. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to obtain the best fit and errors associated with each parameter. We are able to make independent measurements of rotational splittings of {$\sim$}8 radial orders for each star. For all six stars, the measured splittings are consistent with uniform rotation, allowing us to exclude large radial differential rotation.

The new noise model is a significant improvement on the current Kepler results for evolved stars. Our noise model may be used to help understand planet detection thresholds for the ongoing K2 and upcoming TESS missions, and serve as a predictor of stellar noise for these missions. As an application of our noise model, we explore the minimum detectable planet radii for red giant stars, and find that Neptune-sized planets should be detectable around low-luminosity red giant branch stars.},

Our targets have all previously been subject to longterm radial velocity observations to detect orbiting bodies, and satisfy the criteria used by Johnson et al. to select survey stars which may have had A-type (or early F-type) mainsequence progenitors. The sample actually spans a somewhat wider range in mass, from {$\approx$}1 M up to {$\approx$}1.7 M . Whilst for five of the seven stars the reported discovery mass from spectroscopy exceeds the mass estimated using asteroseismology, there is no strong evidence for a significant, systematic bias across the sample. Moreover, comparisons with other masses from the literature show that the absolute scale of any differences is highly sensitive to the chosen reference literature mass, with the scatter between different literature masses significantly larger than reported error bars. We find that any mass difference can be explained through use of different constraints during the recovery process. We also conclude that underestimated uncertainties on the input parameters can significantly bias the recovered stellar masses, which may have contributed to the controversy on the mass scale for retired A stars.},

The need to take into account all possible sources of error is of paramount importance towards a robust determination of stellar properties. We present a study of 34 solar-type stars for which high signal-to-noise asteroseismic data are available from multiyear Kepler photometry. We explore the internal systematics on the stellar properties, that is associated with the uncertainty in the input physics used to construct the stellar models. In particular, we explore the systematics arising from (i) the inclusion of the diffusion of helium and heavy elements; (ii) the uncertainty in solar metallicity mixture; and (iii) different surface correction methods used in optimization/fitting procedures. The systematics arising from comparing results of models with and without diffusion are found to be 0.5 per cent, 0.8 per cent, 2.1 per cent, and 16 per cent in mean density, radius, mass, and age, respectively. The internal systematics in age are significantly larger than the statistical uncertainties. We find the internal systematics resulting from the uncertainty in solar metallicity mixture to be 0.7 per cent in mean density, 0.5 per cent in radius, 1.4 per cent in mass, and 6.7 per cent in age. The surface correction method by Sonoi et al. and Ball \& Gizon's two-term correction produce the lowest internal systematics among the different correction methods, namely, {$\sim$}1 per cent, {$\sim$}1 per cent, {$\sim$}2 per cent, and {$\sim$}8 per cent in mean density, radius, mass, and age, respectively.

From the Kepler photometry we clearly identify nine compact pulsators and a number of interesting binary stars. Of the pulsators, one shows the strong, rapid pulsations typical of a V361 Hya-type sdB variable (sdBV); seven show long-period pulsation characteristics of V1093 Her-type sdBVs; and one shows low-amplitude pulsations with both short and long periods. We derive effective temperatures and surface gravities for all the subdwarf B stars in the sample and demonstrate that below the boundary region where hybrid sdB pulsators are found, all our targets are pulsating. For the stars hotter than this boundary temperature a low fraction of strong pulsators ({$<$}10 per cent) is confirmed. Interestingly, the short-period pulsator also shows a low-amplitude mode in the long-period region, and several of the V1093 Her pulsators show low-amplitude modes in the short-period region, indicating that hybrid behaviour may be common in these stars, also outside the boundary temperature region where hybrid pulsators have hitherto been found.},

In particular, several analyses have demonstrated the possibility to detect non-uniform period spacings, which have been predicted to be directly related to rotation. In this paper, we define a new seismic diagnostic for rotation in {$\gamma$} Doradus stars which are too rapidly rotating to present rotational splittings. Based on the non-uniformity of their period spacings, we define the observable as the slope of the period spacing when plotted as a function of period. We provide a one-to-one relation between this observable and the internal rotation, which applies widely in the instability strip of {$\gamma$} Doradus stars. We apply the diagnostic to a handful of stars observed by Kepler. Thanks to g modes in {$\gamma$} Doradus stars, we are now able to determine the internal rotation of stars on the lower main sequence, which is still not possible for Sun-like stars.},

We found that about half the stars are too faint for the granulation background to be reliably detected above the white noise. We provide a catalogue of log g values for about 15 000 stars having uncertainties better than 0.5 dex.

  abstract = {For flares to be generated, stars have to have a sufficiently deep outer convection zone (F5 and later), strong large-scale magnetic fields (Ap/Bp-type stars) or strong, radiatively driven winds (B5 and earlier). Normal A-type stars possess none of these and therefore should not flare. Nevertheless, flares have previously been detected in the Kepler light curves of 33 A-type stars and interpreted to be intrinsic to the stars. Here, we present new and detailed analyses of these 33 stars, imposing very strict criteria for the flare detection. We confirm the presence of flare-like features in 27 of the 33 A-type stars. A study of the pixel data and the surrounding field of view reveals that 14 of these 27 flaring objects have overlapping neighbouring stars and five stars show clear contamination in the pixel data. We have obtained high-resolution spectra for 2/3 of the entire sample and confirm that our targets are indeed A-type stars. Detailed analyses revealed that 11 out of 19 stars with multiple epochs of observations are spectroscopic binaries. Furthermore, and contrary to previous studies, we find that the flares can originate from a cooler, unresolved companion. We note the presence of H{$\alpha$} emission in eight stars. Whether this emission is circumstellar or magnetic in origin is unknown. In summary, we find possible alternative explanations for the observed flares for at least 19 of the 33 A-type stars, but find no truly convincing target to support the hypothesis of flaring A-type stars.},

  abstract = {Methods. We compute grids of 1D stellar structure and evolution models for two different shapes of convective core overshooting and three shapes of radiative envelope mixing. The models in these grids are compared to a set of benchmark models to evaluate their capability of mimicking the dipole prograde g-modes of the benchmark models.
Results. Through our model comparisons we find that at a central hydrogen content of Xc = 0.5, dipole prograde g-modes in the period range 0.8\textendash{}3 d are capable of differentiating between step and exponential diffusive overshooting. This ability disappears towards the terminal age main sequence at Xc = 0.1. Furthermore, the g-modes behave the same for the three different shapes of radiative envelope mixing considered. However, a constant envelope mixing requires a diffusion coefficient near the convective core five times higher than chemical mixing from internal gravity waves to obtain a surface nitrogen excess of {$\sim$}0.5 dex within the main-sequence lifetime.
Conclusions. Within the estimated frequency errors of the Kepler mission, the ability of g-modes to distinguish between step and exponential diffusive overshooting depends on the evolutionary stage. Combining information from the average period spacing and observed surface abundances, notably nitrogen, could potentially be used to constrain the shape of mixing in the radiative envelope of massive stars.},

Polynomials for griz color\textendash{}temperature relations are presented, along with correction terms for surface gravity effects, metallicity, and statistical corrections for binary companions or blending. We compare our temperature scale to the published infrared flux method (IRFM) scale for VT J Ks in both open clusters and the Kepler fields. We find good agreement overall, with some deviations between (J - Ks)-based temperatures from the IRFM and both SDSS filter and other diagnostic IRFM color\textendash{}temperature relationships above 6000 K. For field dwarfs, we find a mean shift toward hotter temperatures relative to the KIC, of order 215 K, in the regime where the IRFM scale is well defined (4000 K to 6500 K). This change is of comparable magnitude in both color systems and in spectroscopy for stars with Teff below 6000 K. Systematic differences between temperature estimators appear for hotter stars, and we define corrections to put the SDSS temperatures on the IRFM scale for them. When the theoretical dependence on gravity is accounted for, we find a similar temperature scale offset between the fundamental and KIC scales for giants. We demonstrate that statistical corrections to color-based temperatures from binaries are significant. Typical errors, mostly from uncertainties in extinction, are of order 100 K. Implications for other applications of the KIC are discussed.},

Our data includes evolutionary state, surface gravity, mean density, mass, radius, age, and the spectroscopic and asteroseismic measurements used to derive them. We employ a new empirical approach for combining asteroseismic measurements from different methods, calibrating the inferred stellar parameters, and estimating uncertainties. With high statistical significance, we find that asteroseismic parameters inferred from the different pipelines have systematic offsets that are not removed by accounting for differences in their solar reference values. We include theoretically motivated corrections to the large frequency spacing ({$\increment\nu$}) scaling relation, and we calibrate the zero point of the frequency of maximum power ({$\nu$}max) relation to be consistent with masses and radii for members of star clusters. For most targets, the parameters returned by different pipelines are in much better agreement than would be expected from the pipelinepredicted random errors, but 22\% of them had at least one method not return a result and a much larger measurement dispersion. This supports the usage of multiple analysis techniques for asteroseismic stellar population studies. The measured dispersion in mass estimates for fundamental calibrators is consistent with our error model, which yields median random and systematic mass uncertainties for RGB stars of order 4\%. Median random and systematic mass uncertainties are at the 9\% and 8\% level respectively for RC stars.},

  abstract = {Here we present the first data release of the Kepler Smear Campaign, using collateral `smear' data obtained by Kepler to reconstruct light curves of 102 stars too bright to have been otherwise targeted. We describe the pipeline developed to extract and calibrate these light curves, and show that we attain photometric precision comparable to stars analyzed by the standard pipeline in the nominal Kepler mission. In this Paper, we focus in particular on a subset of these consisting of 64 red giants for which we detect solar-like oscillations. Using high-resolution spectroscopy from the Tillinghast Reflector {\'E}chelle Spectrograph (TRES) together with asteroseismic modelling, we obtain the stellar densities and derive masses, radii and ages of 34 of these red giant and red clump stars as benchmarks. All source code, light curves, TRES spectra, and asteroseismic and stellar parameters are publicly available as a Kepler legacy sample.},

  abstract = {The Kepler space mission is devoted to finding Earth-size planets orbiting other stars in their habitable zones. Its large, 105 deg2 field of view features over 156,000 stars that are observed continuously to detect and characterize planet transits. Yet, this high-precision instrument holds great promise for other types of objects as well. Here we present a comprehensive catalog of eclipsing binary stars observed by Kepler in the first 44 days of operation, the data being publicly available through MAST as of 2010 June 15. The catalog contains 1879 unique objects. For each object, we provide its Kepler ID (KID), ephemeris (BJD0, P0), morphology type, physical parameters (Teff, log g, E(B - V )), the estimate of third light contamination (crowding), and principal parameters (T2/T1, q, fillout factor, and sin i for overcontacts, and T2/T1, (R1 + R2)/a, e sin {$\omega$}, e cos {$\omega$}, and sin i for detached binaries). We present statistics based on the determined periods and measure the average occurrence rate of eclipsing binaries to be {$\sim$}1.2\% across the Kepler field. We further discuss the distribution of binaries as a function of galactic latitude and thoroughly explain the application of artificial intelligence to obtain principal parameters in a matter of seconds for the whole sample. The catalog was envisioned to serve as a bridge between the now public Kepler data and the scientific community interested in eclipsing binary stars.},

  abstract = {We present Kepler and Swift observations of StHa 169 which is currently classified as a symbiotic binary. The Kepler light curve shows quasi-periodic behaviour with a mean period of 34 d and an amplitude of a few per cent. Using Swift data, we find a relatively strong UV source at the position of StHa 169 but no X-ray counterpart. Using a simple two-component blackbody fit to model the combined Swift and 2MASS spectral energy distribution and an assessment of the previously published optical spectrum, we find that the source has a hot ({$\sim$}10 000 K) component and a cooler ({$\sim$}3700 K) component. The Kepler light is dominated by the cool component and we attribute the variability to pulsations in a red giant star. If we remove this approximate month long modulation from the light curve, we find no evidence for additional variability in the light curve. The hotter source is assigned to a late B or early A main-sequence star. We briefly discuss the implications of these findings and conclude that StHA 169 is a red giant plus main-sequence binary.},

We find that every sdB star cooler than {$\approx$}27 500 K that Kepler has observed (seven so far) is a long-period pulsator of the V1093 Her (PG 1716) class or a hybrid star with both short and long periods. The apparently non-binary long-period and hybrid pulsators are described here. The V1093 Her periods range from 1 to 4.5 h and are associated with g-mode pulsations. Three stars also exhibit short periods indicative of p-modes with periods of 2\textendash{}5 min and in addition, these stars exhibit periodicities between both classes from 15 to 45 min. We detect the coolest and longest-period V1093 Her-type pulsator to date, KIC010670103 (Teff {$\approx$} 20 900 K, Pmax {$\approx$} 4.5 h) as well as a suspected hybrid pulsator, KIC002697388, which is extremely cool (Teff {$\approx$} 23 900 K) and for the first time hybrid pulsators which have larger g-mode amplitudes than p-mode ones. All of these pulsators are quite rich with many frequencies and we are able to apply asymptotic relationships to associate periodicities with modes for KIC010670103. Kepler data are particularly well suited for these studies as they are long duration, extremely high duty cycle observations with well-behaved noise properties.},

  title = {Rotation and Differential Rotation of Active {{{\emph{Kepler}}}} Stars},
  volume = {560},
  issn = {0004-6361, 1432-0746},
  abstract = {Methods. Active stars were selected from the whole sample using the range of the variability amplitude. To detect different periods in the light curves we used the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in a pre-whitening approach to achieve parameters for a global sine fit. The most dominant periods from the fit were associated to different surface rotation periods. Our purely mathematical approach is capable of detecting different periods but cannot distinguish between the physical origins of periodicity. We ascribe the existence of different periods to DR, but spot evolution could also play a role. Because of the large number of stars the period errors are estimated statistically. We thus cannot exclude the existence of false positives among our periods.
Results. In our sample of 40 661 active stars we found 24 124 rotation periods P1 between 0.5 and 45 days, with a mean of P1 = 16.3 days. The distribution of stars with 0.5 {$<$} B - V {$<$} 1.0 and ages derived from angular momentum evolution that are younger than 300 Myr is consistent with a constant star-formation rate; the detection among older stars is incomplete probably because of our active sample selection. A second period P2 within {$\pm$}30\% of the rotation period P1 was found in 18 616 stars (77.2\%). Attributing these two periods to DR we found that for active stars other than the Sun the relative shear {$\alpha$} increases with rotation period, and slightly decreases with effective temperature. The absolute shear {$\Delta\Omega$} slightly increases from {$\Delta\Omega$} = 0.079 rad d-1 at Teff = 3500 K to {$\Delta\Omega$} = 0.096 rad d-1 at Teff = 6000 K. Above 6000 K, {$\Delta\Omega$} shows much larger scatter. The dependence of {$\Delta\Omega$} on rotation period is weak over a large period range.
Conclusions. Latitudinal differential rotation measured for the first time in more than 18 000 stars provides a comprehensive picture of stellar surface shear. This picture is consistent with major predictions from mean-field theory, and seems to support these models. To what extent our observations are prone to false positives and selection bias has not been fully explored, and needs to be addressed using other data, including the full Kepler time coverage.},

  abstract = {Methods. Using a recent sample of active stars we compute the rotation period and the variability amplitude for each individual Kepler quarter and search for periodic variations of both time series. To test for periodicity in each stellar time series we consider Lomb-Scargle periodograms and use a selection based on a false alarm probability (FAP).
Results. We detect amplitude periodicities in 3203 stars between 0.5 {$<$} Pcyc {$<$} 6 yr covering rotation periods between 1 {$<$} Prot {$<$} 40 days. Given our sample size of 23 601 stars and our selection criteria that the FAP is less than 5\%, this number is almost three times higher than that expected from pure noise. We do not detect periodicities in the rotation period beyond those expected from noise. Our measurements reveal that the cycle period shows a weak dependence on rotation rate, slightly increasing for longer rotation periods. We further show that the shape of the variability deviates from a pure sine curve, consistent with observations of the solar cycle. The cycle shape does not show a statistically significant dependence on effective temperature.
Conclusions. We detect activity cycles in more than 13\% of our final sample with a FAP of 5\% (calculated by randomly shuffling the measured 90-day variability measurements for each star). Our measurements do not support the existence of distinct sequences in the Prot - Pcyc plane, although there is some evidence for the inactive sequence for rotation periods between 5\textendash{}25 days. Unfortunately, the total observing time is too short to draw sound conclusions on activity cycles with similar lengths to that of the solar cycle.},

  abstract = {We present a first determination of distances and extinctions for individual stars in the first release of the APOKASC catalogue, built from the joint efforts of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium (KASC). Our method takes into account the spectroscopic constraints derived from the APOGEE Stellar Parameters and Chemical Abundances Pipeline, together with the asteroseismic parameters from KASC. These parameters are then employed to estimate intrinsic stellar properties, including absolute magnitudes, using the Bayesian tool PARAM. We then find the distance and extinction that best fit the observed photometry in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), 2MASS, and WISE passbands. The first 1989 giants targetted by APOKASC are found at typical distances between 0.5 and 5 kpc, with individual uncertainties of just {$\sim$}1.8 per cent. Our extinction estimates are systematically smaller than provided in the Kepler Input Catalogue and by the Schlegel et al. maps. Distances to individual stars in the NGC 6791 and NGC 6819 star clusters agree to within their credible intervals. Comparison with the APOGEE red clump and SAGA catalogues provide another useful check, exhibiting agreement with our measurements to within a few per cent. Overall, present methods seem to provide excellent distance and extinction determinations for the bulk of the APOKASC sample. Approximately one third of the stars present broad or multiple-peaked probability density functions and hence increased uncertainties. Uncertainties are expected to be reduced in future releases of the catalogue, when a larger fraction of the stars will have seismically determined evolutionary status classifications.},

Methods. We use theoretical analysis, phase shifts, and model fitting. Results. We define the inner and outer phase shifts of a frequency set of a model star and show that the outer phase shifts are (almost) independent of degree , and that a function of the inner phase shifts (the phase function) collapses to an independent function of frequency in the outer layers. We then show how to use this result in a model fitting technique to find a best fit model to an observed frequency set by calculating the inner phase shifts of a model using the observed frequencies and determining the extent to which the phase function collapses to a single function of frequency in the outer layers. This technique does not depend on the radial order n assigned to the observed frequencies. We give two examples applying this technique to the frequency sets of HD 49933 observed by CoRoT and HD 177153 (aka Perky) observed by Kepler, for which measurements of angular diameters and bolometric fluxes are available. For HD 49933 we find a very wide range of models to be consistent with the data (all with convective core overshooting) \textendash{} and conclude that the data is not precise enough to make any useful restrictions on the structure of this star. For HD 177153 our best fit models have no convective cores, masses in the range 1.15-1.17 M , ages of 4.45-4.70 \texttimes{} 109 yr, Z in the range 0.021-0.024, XH = 0.71-0.72, Y = 0.256-0.266 and mixing length parameter {$\alpha$} = 1.8. We compare our results to those of previous studies. We contrast the phase matching technique to that using the ratios of small to large separations, showing that it avoids the problem of correlated errors in separation ratio fitting and of assigning radial order n to the modes.},

  abstract = {We test asteroseismic radii of Kepler main-sequence and subgiant stars by deriving their parallaxes which are compared with those of the first Gaia data release. We compute radii based on the asteroseismic scaling relations as well as by fitting observed oscillation frequencies to stellar models for a subset of the sample, and test the impact of using effective temperatures from either spectroscopy or the infrared flux method. An offset of 3 per cent, showing no dependency on any stellar parameters, is found between seismic parallaxes derived from frequency modelling and those from Gaia. For parallaxes based on radii from the scaling relations, a smaller offset is found on average; however, the offset becomes temperature dependent which we interpret as problems with the scaling relations at high stellar temperatures. Using the hotter infrared flux method temperature scale, there is no indication that radii from the scaling relations are inaccurate by more than about 5 per cent. Taking the radii and masses from the modelling of individual frequencies as reference values, we seek to correct the scaling relations for the observed temperature trend. This analysis indicates that the scaling relations systematically overestimate radii and masses at high temperatures, and that they are accurate to within 5 per cent in radius and 13 per cent in mass for main-sequence stars with temperatures below 6400 K. However, further analysis is required to test the validity of the corrections on a star-by-star basis and for more evolved stars.},

Comparison with models shows that the star has a mass of about 1.45 M , and is at an advanced stage of main-sequence evolution in which the central hydrogen abundance mass fraction is reduced to about 0.1. This is the second case, following KIC 11145123, of an asteroseismic determination of the rotation of the deep core and surface of an A-F main-sequence star. We have found, essentially model independently, that the rotation near the surface, obtained from p-mode splittings, is 66 d, slightly slower than the rotation of 64 d in the core, measured by g-mode splittings. KIC 9244992 is similar to KIC 11145123 in that both are near the end of main-sequence stage with very slow and nearly uniform rotation. This indicates the angular momentum transport in the interior of an A-F star during the main-sequence stage is much stronger than that expected from standard theoretical formulations.},

Until now, however, discussion of r modes (global Rossby waves) has been rare. Here we derive the expected frequency ranges of r modes in the observational frame by considering the visibility of these modes. We find that the frequencies of r modes of azimuthal order m appear as groups at slightly lower frequency than m times the rotation frequency. Comparing the visibility curves for r modes with Fourier amplitude spectra of Kepler light curves of upper main-sequence B, A, and F stars, we find that r modes are present in many {$\gamma$} Dor stars (as first discovered by Van Reeth et al.), spotted stars, and so-called heartbeat stars, which are highly eccentric binary stars. We also find a signature of r modes in a frequently bursting Be star observed by Kepler. In the amplitude spectra of moderately to rapidly rotating {$\gamma$} Dor stars, r-mode frequency groups appear at lower frequency than prograde g-mode frequency groups, while in the amplitude spectra of spotted early A to B stars, groups of symmetric (with respect to the equator) r-mode frequencies appear just below the frequency of a structured peak that we suggest represents an approximate stellar rotation rate. In many heartbeat stars, a group of frequencies can be fitted with symmetric m = 1 r modes, which can be used to obtain rotation frequencies of these stars.},

The photospheric (S ph) and chromospheric (S index) magnetic activity levels of these seismic solar analogs are estimated and compared in relation to the solar activity. We show that the activity of the Sun is comparable to the activity of the seismic solar analogs, within the maximum-to-minimum temporal variations of the 11-yr solar activity cycle 23. In agreement with previous studies, the youngest stars and fastest rotators in our sample are actually the most active. The activity of stars older than the Sun seems to not evolve much with age. Furthermore, the comparison of the photospheric, S ph, with the well-established chromospheric, S index, indicates that the S ph index can be used to provide a suitable magnetic activity proxy which can be easily estimated for a large number of stars from space photometric observations.},

The frequency shifts are observed to increase towards higher-order modes to reach a maximum of about 0.8 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz over the 11-yr solar cycle. A comparable frequency dependence is also measured in two other main sequence solar-like stars, the F-star HD 49933, and the young 1 Gyr-old solar analog KIC 10644253, although with different amplitudes of the shifts of about 2 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz and 0.5 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz, respectively. Our objective here is to extend this analysis to stars with different masses, metallicities, and evolutionary stages. From an initial set of 87 Kepler solar-like oscillating stars with known individual p-mode frequencies, we identify five stars showing frequency shifts that can be considered reliable using selection criteria based on Monte Carlo simulations and on the photospheric magnetic activity proxy S ph. The frequency dependence of the frequency shifts of four of these stars could be measured for the l = 0 and l = 1 modes individually. Given the quality of the data, the results could indicate that a physical source of perturbation different from that in the Sun is dominating in this sample of solar-like stars.},

Yet, the {$\gamma$} Dor pulsations remain hard to detect from the ground for their periods are close to 1 day.

It revealed regularities in the spectra, expected to bear signature of physical processes, including rotation, in the shear layers close to the convective core. We present here the first results of our effort to derive exploitable seismic diagnosis for mid- to fast rotators among {$\gamma$} Dor stars.

  abstract = {In the Sun, the frequencies of the acoustic modes are observed to vary in phase with the magnetic activity level. These frequency variations are expected to be common in solar-type stars and contain information about the activity-related changes that take place in their interiors. The unprecedented duration of Kepler photometric timeseries provides a unique opportunity to detect and characterize stellar magnetic cycles through asteroseismology. In this work, we analyze a sample of 87 solar-type stars, measuring their temporal frequency shifts over segments of 90 days. For each segment, the individual frequencies are obtained through a Bayesian peak-bagging tool. The mean frequency shifts are then computed and compared with: (1) those obtained from a cross-correlation method; (2) the variation in the mode heights; (3) a photometric activity proxy; and (4) the characteristic timescale of the granulation. For each star and 90-day sub-series, we provide mean frequency shifts, mode heights, and characteristic timescales of the granulation. Interestingly, more than 60\% of the stars show evidence for (quasi-) periodic variations in the frequency shifts. In the majority of the cases, these variations are accompanied by variations in other activity proxies. About 20\% of the stars show mode frequencies and heights varying approximately in phase, in opposition to what is observed for the Sun.},

KIC 10080943 is a binary system that contains two gravity- and pressure-mode hybrid pulsators. A detailed observational study has provided fundamental and seismic parameters for both components.},

Robo-AO allows us to resolve blended secondary sources at separations as close as {$\sim$}0 15 that may contribute to the measured Kepler light curves and affect asteroseismic analysis and interpretation. We report eight new secondary sources within 4 0 of these Kepler asteroseismic stars. We used Subaru and Keck AOs to measure differential infrared photometry for these candidate companion systems. Two of the secondary sources are likely foreground objects, while the remaining six are background sources; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that three of the objects may be physically associated. We measured a range of i{${'}$}-band amplitude dilutions for the candidate companion systems from 0.43\% to 15.4\%. We find that the measured amplitude dilutions are insufficient to explain the previously identified excess scatter in the relationship between asteroseismic oscillation amplitude and the frequency of maximum power.},

  abstract = {We present the first APOKASC catalog of spectroscopic and asteroseismic data for dwarfs and subgiants. Asteroseismic data for our sample of 415 objects have been obtained by the Kepler mission in short (58.5s) cadence, and light curves span from 30 up to more than 1000days. The spectroscopic parameters are based on spectra taken as part of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment and correspond to Data Release 13 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We analyze our data using two independent Teff scales, the spectroscopic values from DR13 and those derived from SDSS griz photometry. We use the differences in our results arising from these choices as a test of systematic temperature uncertainties and find that they can lead to significant differences in the derived stellar properties. Determinations of surface gravity (log g), mean density ({\'a}r{\~n}), radius (R), mass (M), and age ({$\tau$}) for the whole sample have been carried out by means of (stellar) grid-based modeling. We have thoroughly assessed random and systematic error sources in the spectroscopic and asteroseismic data, as well as in the grid-based modeling determination of the stellar quantities provided in the catalog. We provide stellar properties determined for each of the two Teff scales. The median combined (random and systematic) uncertainties are 2\% (0.01 dex; log g), 3.4\% ({\'a}r{\~n}), 2.6\% (R), 5.1\% (M), and 19\% ({$\tau$}) for the photometric Teff scale and 2\% (log g), 3.5\% ({\'a}r{\~n}), 2.7\% (R), 6.3\% (M), and 23\% ({$\tau$}) for the spectroscopic scale. We present comparisons with stellar quantities in the asteroseismic catalog by Chaplin et al. that highlight the importance of having metallicity measurements for determining stellar parameters accurately. Finally, we compare our results with those coming from a variety of sources, including stellar radii determined from TGAS parallaxes and asteroseismic analyses based on individual frequencies. We find a very good agreement for all inferred quantities. The latter comparison, in particular, gives strong support to the determination of stellar quantities based on global seismology, a relevant result for future missions such as TESS and PLATO.},

  abstract = {With current space-based missions it is now possible to obtain age-sensitive asteroseismic information for tens of thousands of red giants. This provides a promising opportunity to study the Galactic structure and evolution. We use asteroseismic data of red giants, observed by Kepler, to test the current theoretical framework of modeling the Galaxy based on population synthesis modeling and the use of asteroseismic scaling relations for giants. We use the open source code Galaxia to model the Milky Way and find the distribution of the masses predicted by Galaxia to be systematically offset with respect to the seismically inferred observed masses. The Galactic model overestimates the number of low-mass stars, and these stars are predominantly old and of low metallicity. Using corrections to the Dn scaling relation suggested by stellar models significantly reduces the disagreement between predicted and observed masses. For a few cases where non-seismic mass estimates are available, the corrections to Dn also improve the agreement between seismic and non-seismic mass estimates. The disagreement between predictions of the Galactic model and the observations is most pronounced for stars with [Fe/H] {$<$} -0.5 and [Fe/H] {$>$} 0 or for Teff {$>$} 4700 K. Altering the star formation rate in order to suppress stars older than 10 Gyr improves the agreement for mass but leads to inconsistent color distributions. We also tested the predictions of the TRILEGAL Galactic model. However, unlike Galaxia, it had difficulties in reproducing the photometric properties of the Kepler Input Catalog because it overestimates the number of blue stars. We conclude that either the scaling relations and/or the Galactic models need to be revised to reconcile predictions of theory with asteroseismic observations.},

Here, we revisit the analysis of the asteroseismic sample of dwarf and subgiant stars observed by Kepler and investigate in detail the possible causes for the reported discrepancy. We investigate two models of the Milky Way based on stellar population synthesis, Galaxia and TRILEGAL. In agreement with previous results, we find that TRILEGAL predicts more massive stars compared to Galaxia, and that TRILEGAL predicts too many blue stars compared to 2MASS observations. Both models fail to match the distribution of the stellar sample in (log g, Teff) space, pointing to inaccuracies in the models and/or the assumed selection function. When corrected for this mismatch in (log g, Teff) space, the mass distribution calculated by Galaxia is broader and the mean is shifted toward lower masses compared to that of the observed stars. This behavior is similar to what has been reported for the Kepler red giant sample. The shift between the mass distributions is equivalent to a change of 2\% in {$\nu$}max, which is within the current uncertainty in the {$\nu$}max scaling relation. Applying corrections to the {$\Delta\nu$} scaling relation predicted by the stellar models makes the observed mass distribution significantly narrower, but there is no change to the mean.},

  abstract = {Some pulsating stars are good clocks. When they are found in binary stars, the frequencies of their luminosity variations are modulated by the Doppler effect caused by orbital motion. For each pulsation frequency this manifests itself as a multiplet separated by the orbital frequency in the Fourier transform of the light curve of the star. We derive the theoretical relations to exploit data from the Fourier transform to derive all the parameters of a binary system traditionally extracted from spectroscopic radial velocities, including the mass function which is easily derived from the amplitude ratio of the first orbital sidelobes to the central frequency for each pulsation frequency. This is a new technique that yields radial velocities from the Doppler shift of a pulsation frequency, thus eliminates the need to obtain spectra. For binary stars with pulsating components, an orbital solution can be obtained from the light curve alone. We give a complete derivation of this and demonstrate it both with artificial data, and with a case of a hierarchical eclipsing binary with Kepler mission data, KIC 4150611 (HD 181469). We show that it is possible to detect Jupiter-mass planets orbiting {$\delta$} Sct and other pulsating stars with our technique. We also show how to distinguish orbital frequency multiplets from potentially similar non-radial m-mode multiplets and from oblique pulsation multiplets.},

The field of asteroseismology has been thought to be particularly successful in such an endeavor for stars in different evolutionary stages. However, to fully exploit its potential, robust methods for estimating stellar parameters are required and independent verification of the results is mandatory. With this purpose, we present a new technique to obtain stellar properties by coupling asteroseismic analysis with the InfraRed Flux Method. By using two global seismic observables and multi-band photometry, the technique allows us to obtain masses, radii, effective temperatures, bolometric fluxes, and hence distances for field stars in a self-consistent manner. We apply our method to 22 solar-like oscillators in the Kepler short-cadence sample, that have accurate Hipparcos parallaxes. Our distance determinations agree to better than 5\%, while measurements of spectroscopic effective temperatures and interferometric radii also validate our results. We briefly discuss the potential of our technique for stellar population analysis and models of Galactic Chemical Evolution.},

Our results reveal that best-fit models found solely by matching individual frequencies of oscillations corrected for surface effects do not always properly reproduce frequency combinations. Moreover, slightly different criteria to define what the best-fit model is can lead to solutions with similar global properties but very different interior structures. We argue that the use of frequency ratios is a more reliable way to obtain accurate stellar parameters, and show that our analysis in field main-sequence stars can yield an overall precision of 1.5\%, 4\%, and 10\% in radius, mass, and age, respectively.

We implement a new Bayesian scheme that is flexible in its input to process individual oscillation frequencies, combinations of them, and average asteroseismic parameters, and derive robust fundamental properties for these targets. Applying this scheme to grids of evolutionary models yields stellar properties with median statistical uncertainties of 1.2 per cent (radius), 1.7 per cent (density), 3.3 per cent (mass), 4.4 per cent (distance), and 14 per cent (age), making this the exoplanet host-star sample with the most precise and uniformly determined fundamental parameters to date. We assess the systematics from changes in the solar abundances and mixing-length parameter, showing that they are smaller than the statistical errors. We also determine the stellar properties with three other fitting algorithms and explore the systematics arising from using different evolution and pulsation codes, resulting in 1 per cent in density and radius, and 2 per cent and 7 per cent in mass and age, respectively. We confirm previous findings of the initial helium abundance being a source of systematics comparable to our statistical uncertainties, and discuss future prospects for constraining this parameter by combining asteroseismology and data from space missions. Finally, we compare our derived properties with those obtained using the global average asteroseismic observables along with effective temperature and metallicity, finding excellent level of agreement. Owing to selection effects, our results show that the majority of the high signal-to-noise ratio asteroseismic Kepler host stars are older than the Sun.},

Comparisons among the different results reveal a good level of agreement in all stellar properties, which is remarkable considering the variety of codes, input physics, and analysis methods employed by the different teams.

We analyze 11 months of 1 minute cadence data from Kepler, presenting Kepler flare frequency distributions, as well as determining correlations between flare energy, amplitude, duration, and decay time. We find that the exponent {$\alpha$} of the power-law flare energy distribution varies in time, primarily due to completeness of sample and the low frequency of high-energy flares. We also find a deviation from a single power law at high energy. We use ground-based spectroscopic observations that were simultaneous with the Kepler data to provide simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic analysis of three low-energy flares, the lowest-energy dMe flares with detailed spectral analysis to date on any star. The spectroscopic data from these flares extend constraints for radiative hydrodynamic flare models to a lower energy regime than has previously been studied. We use this simultaneous spectroscopy and Kepler photometry to develop approximate conversions from the Kepler bandpass to the traditional U and B bands. This conversion will be a critical factor in comparing any Kepler flare analyses to the canon of previous ground-based flare studies.},

  abstract = {KIC 10001893 is one out of 19 subdwarf-B (sdB) pulsators observed by the Kepler spacecraft in its primary mission. In addition to tens of pulsation frequencies in the g-mode domain, its Fourier spectrum shows three weak peaks at very low frequencies, which is too low to be explained in terms of g modes. The most convincing explanation is that we are seeing the orbital modulation of three Earth-size planets (or planetary remnants) in very tight orbits, which are illuminated by the strong stellar radiation. The orbital periods are P1 = 5.273, P2 = 7.807, and P3 = 19.48 h, and the period ratios P2/P1 = 1.481 and P3/P2 = 2.495 are very close to the 3:2 and 5:2 resonances, respectively. One of the main pulsation modes of the star at 210.68 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz corresponds to the third harmonic of the orbital frequency of the inner planet, suggesting that we see, for the first time in an sdB star, g-mode pulsations tidally excited by a planetary companion. The extreme planetary system that emerges from the Kepler data is very similar to the recent discovery of two Earth-size planets orbiting the sdB pulsator KIC 05807616 (Charpinet et al. 2011a).},

A frequency analysis of the eclipse-subtracted light curve reveals at least 68 frequencies, of which 55 or more can be attributed to pulsation modes. The main limitation on this analysis is the frequency resolution within the 27-d short-cadence light curve. Most of the variability signal lies in the frequency range 18\textendash{}31 d-1, with amplitudes between 0.1 and 4 mmag. One harmonic term (2f ) and a few combination frequencies (fi + fj) have been detected. From a plot of the residuals versus orbital phase, we assign the pulsations to the primary star in the system. The pulsations were removed from the short-cadence data and the light curve was modelled using the Wilson\textendash{}Devinney code. We are unable to get a perfect fit due to the residual effects of pulsations and also to the treatment of reflection and reprocessing in the light-curve model. A model where the secondary star fills its Roche lobe is favoured, which means that KIC 10661783 can be classified as an oEA system. Further photometric and spectroscopic observations will allow the masses and radii of the two stars to be measured to high precision and hundreds of {$\delta$} Scuti pulsation frequencies to be resolved. This could lead to unique constraints on theoretical models of {$\delta$} Scuti stars, if the evolutionary history of KIC 10661783 can be accounted for.},

  abstract = {We present models of the components of the systems KOI-126 and CM Draconis, the two eclipsing binary systems known to date to contain stars with masses low enough to have fully convective interiors. We are able to model satisfactorily the system KOI-126, finding consistent solutions for the radii and surface temperatures of all three components, using a solar-like value of the mixing-length parameter {$\alpha$} in the convection zone and PHOENIX NextGen 1D model atmospheres for the surface boundary conditions. Depending on the chemical composition, we estimate the age of the system to be in the range 3\textendash{}5 Gyr. For CM Draconis, on the other hand, we cannot reconcile our models with the observed radii and Teff using the current metal-poor composition estimate based on kinematics. Higher metallicities lessen but do not remove the discrepancy. We then explore the effect of varying the mixing-length parameter {$\alpha$}. As previously noted in the literature, a reduced {$\alpha$} can be used as a simple measure of the lower convective efficiency due to rotation and induced magnetic fields. Our models show a sensitivity to {$\alpha$} (for {$\alpha$} {$<$} 1.0) sufficient to partially account for the radius discrepancies. It is, however, impossible to reconcile the models with the observations on the basis of the effect of the reduced {$\alpha$} alone. We therefore suggest that the combined effects of high metallicity and {$\alpha$} reduction could explain the observations of CM Draconis. For example, increasing the metallicity of the system towards super-solar values (i.e. Z = 2 Z ) yields an agreement within 2{$\sigma$} with {$\alpha$} = 1.0.},

  abstract = {Scaling relations that link asteroseismic quantities to global stellar properties are important for gaining understanding of the intricate physics that underpins stellar pulsations. The common notion that all stars in an open cluster have essentially the same distance, age, and initial composition implies that the stellar parameters can be measured to much higher precision than what is usually achievable for single stars. This makes clusters ideal for exploring the relation between the mode amplitude of solar-like oscillations and the global stellar properties. We have analyzed data obtained with NASA's Kepler space telescope to study solar-like oscillations in 100 red giant stars located in either of the three open clusters, NGC 6791, NGC 6819, and NGC 6811. By fitting the measured amplitudes to predictions from simple scaling relations that depend on luminosity, mass, and effective temperature, we find that the data cannot be described by any power of the luminosity-to-mass ratio as previously assumed. As a result we provide a new improved empirical relation which treats luminosity and mass separately. This relation turns out to also work remarkably well for main-sequence and subgiant stars. In addition, the measured amplitudes reveal the potential presence of a number of previously unknown unresolved binaries in the red clump in NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, pointing to an interesting new application for asteroseismology as a probe into the formation history of open clusters.},

This makes clusters excellent test benches for verification of stellar evolution theory.

Techniques for determining cluster membership therefore play a key role in the investigation of clusters. We present results on three clusters in the Kepler field of view based on a newly established technique that uses asteroseismology to identify fore- or background stars in the field, which demonstrates advantages over classical methods such as kinematic and photometry measurements. Four previously identified seismic non-members in NGC 6819 are confirmed in this study, and three additional non-members are found\textemdash{}two in NGC 6819 and one in NGC 6791.

More than 13,000 (over 85\%) of these stars show intrinsic flux variability caused by solar-like oscillations making them ideal for large-scale asteroseismic investigations. We automatically extracted individual frequencies and measured the period spacings of the dipole modes in nearly every red giant. These measurements naturally classify the stars into various populations, such as the red giant branch, the low-mass (M/M 1.8) helium-core-burning red clump, and the higher-mass (M/M 1.8) secondary clump. The period spacings also reveal that a large fraction of the stars show rotationally induced frequency splittings.

  abstract = {The success of asteroseismology relies heavily on our ability to identify the frequency patterns of stellar oscillation modes. For stars like the Sun this is relatively easy because the mode frequencies follow a regular pattern described by a well-founded asymptotic relation. When a solar-like star evolves off the main sequence and onto the red giant branch its structure changes dramatically, resulting in changes in the frequency pattern of the modes. We follow the evolution of the adiabatic frequency pattern from the main sequence to near the tip of the red giant branch for a series of models. We find a significant departure from the asymptotic relation for the non-radial modes near the red giant branch tip, resulting in a triplet frequency pattern. To support our investigation we analyze almost four years of Kepler data of the most luminous stars in the field (late K and early M type) and find that their frequency spectra indeed show a triplet pattern dominated by dipole modes even for the most luminous stars in our sample. Our identification explains previous results from ground-based observations reporting fine structure in the Petersen diagram and sub-ridges in the period\textendash{}luminosity diagram. Finally, we find ``new ridges'' of non-radial modes with frequencies below the fundamental mode in our model calculations, and we speculate they are related to f modes.},

  abstract = {An exciting new theoretical result shows that observing suppression of dipole oscillation modes in red giant stars can be used to detect strong magnetic fields in the stellar cores. A fundamental facet of the theory is that nearly all the mode energy leaking into the core is trapped by the magnetic greenhouse effect. This results in clear predictions for how the mode visibility changes as a star evolves up the red giant branch, and how that depends on stellar mass, spherical degree, and mode lifetime. Here, we investigate the validity of these predictions with a focus on the visibility of different spherical degrees. We find that mode suppression weakens for higher degree modes with a reduction in the quadrupole mode visibility of up to 49\%, and no detectable suppression of octupole modes, in agreement with theory. We find evidence for the influence of increasing mode lifetimes on the visibilities along the red giant branch, in agreement with previous independent observations. These results support the theory that strong internal magnetic fields cause suppression of non-radial modes in red giants. We also find preliminary evidence that stars with suppressed dipole modes on average have slightly lower metallicity than normal stars.},

These errors, which include discontinuities, systematic trends, and outliers, obscure the astrophysical signals in the light curves. To correct these errors is the task of the Presearch Data Conditioning (PDC) module of the Kepler data analysis pipeline. The original version of PDC in Kepler did not meet the extremely high performance requirements for the detection of miniscule planet transits or highly accurate analysis of stellar activity and rotation. One particular deficiency was that astrophysical features were often removed as a side effect of the removal of errors. In this article we introduce the completely new and significantly improved version of PDC which was implemented in Kepler SOC version 8.0. This new PDC version, which utilizes a Bayesian approach for removal of systematics, reliably corrects errors in the light curves while at the same time preserving planet transits and other astrophysically interesting signals. We describe the architecture and the algorithms of this new PDC module, show typical errors encountered in Kepler data, and illustrate the corrections using real light curve examples.},

Interestingly, all these pulsating stars show Blazhko modulation. The period doubling manifests itself as alternating maxima and minima of the pulsational cycles in the light curve, as well as through the appearance of half-integer frequencies located halfway between the main pulsation period and its harmonics in the frequency spectrum. The effect was found to be stronger during certain phases of the modulation cycle. We were able to reproduce the period-doubling bifurcation in our non-linear RR Lyrae models computed by the Florida\textendash{}Budapest hydrocode. This enabled us to trace the origin of this instability in RR Lyrae stars to a resonance, namely a 9:2 resonance between the fundamental mode and a high-order (ninth) radial overtone showing strange-mode characteristics. We discuss the connection of this new type of variation to the mysterious Blazhko effect and argue that it may give us fresh insights into solving this century-old enigma.},

New radial velocity data are consistent with previous measurements, suggesting that a long-period binary component is unlikely.

The atmospheric parameters (Teff = 7600 K, log g = 4.2, {$\xi$} = 3.1 km s-1 and [Fe/H] = -0.71 dex), the radial and rotation velocities, and elemental abundances were obtained by analysing line strengths and fitting line profiles, which were calculated with a 1D LTE model atmosphere. The main properties of KIC 11145123 are: (1) a low [Fe/H] = -0.71 {$\pm$} 0.11 dex and a high radial velocity of -135.4 {$\pm$} 0.2 km s-1. These are remarkable among late-A stars. Our best asteroseismic models with this low [Fe/H] have slightly high helium abundance and low masses of 1.4 M . All of these results strongly suggest that KIC 11145123 is a Population II blue straggler; (2) the projected rotation velocity confirms the asteroseismically predicted slow rotation of the star; (3) comparisons of abundance patterns between KIC 11145123 and Am, Ap, and blue stragglers show that KIC 11145123 is neither an Am star nor an Ap star, but has abundances consistent with a blue straggler. We conclude that the remarkably long 100-d rotation period of this star is a consequence of it being a blue straggler, but both pathways for the formation of blue stragglers \textendash{} merger and mass loss in a binary system \textendash{} pose difficulties for our understanding of the exceedingly slow rotation.

These two kinds of spectroscopic and seismic information suffice to define the position on the `luminosity versus effective temperature' diagram and to assign an appropriate theoretical evolutionary track to each star. Making use of this advantage, we examined whether the stellar location on this diagram really matches the assigned track, which would make an interesting consistency check between theory and observation. It turned out that satisfactory agreement was confirmed in most cases ({$\sim$}90 per cent, though appreciable discrepancies were seen for some stars such as higher mass red-clump giants), suggesting that recent stellar evolution calculations are practically reliable. Since the relevant stellar age could also be obtained by this comparison, we derived the age\textendash{}metallicity relation for these Kepler giants and found the following characteristics: (1) the resulting distribution is quite similar to what was previously concluded for F-, G-, and K-type stars dwarfs; (2) the dispersion of metallicity progressively increases as the age becomes older; (3) nevertheless, the maximum metallicity at any stellar age remains almost flat, which means the existence of super/near-solar metallicity stars in a considerably wide age range from {$\sim$}(2\textendash{}3) \texttimes{} 108 to {$\sim$}1010 yr.},

(PASJ, 60, 781), since it may be possible to discriminate their complex evolutionary status by using the surface gravity versus mass diagram. We confirmed that our spectroscopic gravity and the seismic gravity satisfactorily agree with each other (to within 0.1 dex) without any systematic difference. However, the mass values of Heburning red clump giants derived from stellar evolutionary tracks ({$\sim$}2\textendash{}3 M ) were found to be markedly larger by {$\sim$}50 per cent compared to the seismic values ({$\sim$}1\textendash{}2 M ) though such discrepancy is not seen for normal giants in the H-burning phase, which reflects the difficulty of mass determination from intricately overlapping tracks on the luminosity versus effective temperature diagram. This consequence implies that the mass results of many red giants in the clump region determined by Takeda et al. are likely to be significantly overestimated. We also compare our spectroscopically established parameters with recent literature values, and further discuss the prospect of distinguishing the evolutionary status of red giants based on the conventional (i.e. non-seismic) approach.},

We find that this effect is present in all model grids tested, and that theoretical uncertainties in the models, correlated spectroscopic errors, and shifts in the asteroseismic mass scale are insufficient to explain this effect. Stellar models can be brought into agreement with the data if a metallicity-dependent convective mixing length is used, with {$\Delta\alpha$}ML, YREC{$\sim$}0.2 per dex in metallicity, a trend inconsistent with the predictions of three-dimensional stellar convection simulations.

Based on 1460 d of Kepler observations we perform a thorough asteroseismic study to probe the stellar parameters and evolutionary stages of three red giants in eclipsing binary systems. We present the first detailed analysis of individual oscillation modes of the red-giant components of KIC 8410637, KIC 5640750, and KIC 9540226. We obtain estimates of their asteroseismic masses, radii, mean densities, and logarithmic surface gravities by using the asteroseismic scaling relations as well as grid-based modelling. As these red giants are in double-lined eclipsing binaries, it is possible to derive their independent dynamical masses and radii from the orbital solution and compare it with the seismically inferred values. For KIC 5640750 we compute the first spectroscopic orbit based on both components of this system. We use high-resolution spectroscopic data and light curves of the three systems to determine up-to-date values of the dynamical stellar parameters. With our comprehensive set of stellar parameters we explore consistencies between binary analysis and asteroseismic methods, and test the reliability of the well-known scaling relations. For the three red giants under study, we find agreement between dynamical and asteroseismic stellar parameters in cases where the asteroseismic methods account for metallicity, temperature, and mass dependence as well as surface effects. We are able to attain agreement from the scaling laws in all three systems if we use {$\nu$}ref,emp = 130.8 {$\pm$} 0.9 {$\mu$}Hz instead of the usual solar reference value.},

This hypothesis is supported by spectroscopic radial velocity measurements for five systems, each showing evidence of being in an eccentric binary system. Prior to the discovery of these 17 new systems, only four stars, where KOI-54 is the best example, were known to have evidence of these dynamic tides and tidally induced oscillations. We perform preliminary fits to the light curves and radial velocity data, present the overall properties of this class, and discuss the work required to accurately model these systems.},

  abstract = {Context. Asteroseismology is a powerful tool for investigating physical processes in stars. Solar-like oscillations of main-sequence stars and red giant stars have been observed through ground-based observations and space missions. Aims. We analyzed seven seasons of short-cadence data, which was obtained with the Kepler Mission and corrected by WG\#1, of a solar-type star of spectral type F: KIC 6225718 and obtained more information concerning solar-like stars. Methods. We extracted oscillation modes from the power spectrum of KIC 6225718 and compared the theoretical acoustic spectrum with the extracted modes in order to determine the parameters of the star accurately. Results. We identified 33 p-modes with angular degree l=0-2 in the frequency range of 1600 - 2800 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz, and obtained the large frequency separation {$\increment\nu$} = 105.78 {$\pm$} 0.65 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz and the frequency of maximum power spectrum {$\nu$}max = 2301 {$\pm$} 21 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz. We got values for the star's physical parameters: the range of mass M = 1.13{$\pm$}0.03M{$\odot$}, the radius R = 1.23{$\pm$}0.01R{$\odot$}, and the age t = 3.03{$\pm$}0.42 Gyr, which is at the phase of main sequence. We analyzed the effects of overshooting, and determined that the models with overshooting {$\alpha$}ov = 0.2 are in better agreement with observations. The ratio of small to large separations r01 which is related to the internal structure of the star could be used to test physical processes in stellar interiors free from the near-surface effects.},

  abstract = {Methods. We applied an automated supervised photometric classification method to select a sample of 69 Gamma Doradus ({$\gamma$} Dor) candidate stars. We used an advanced method to extract the Kepler light curves from the pixel data information using custom masks. For 36 of the stars, we obtained high-resolution spectroscopy with the HERMES spectrograph installed at the Mercator telescope. The spectroscopic data are analysed to determine the fundamental parameters like Teff, log g, v sin i, and [M/H].
Results. We find that all stars for which spectroscopic estimates of Teff and log g are available fall into the region of the HR diagram, where the {$\gamma$} Dor and {$\delta$} Sct instability strips overlap. The stars cluster in a 700 K window in effective temperature; log g measurements suggest luminosity class IV-V, i.e. sub-giant or main-sequence stars. From the Kepler photometry, we identify 45 {$\gamma$} Dor-type pulsators, 14 {$\gamma$} Dor/{$\delta$} Sct hybrids, and 10 stars, which are classified as ``possibly {$\gamma$} Dor/{$\delta$} Sct hybrid pulsators''. We find a clear correlation between the spectroscopically derived v sin i and the frequencies of independent pulsation modes.
Conclusions. We have shown that our photometric classification based on the light curve morphology and colour information is very robust. The results of spectroscopic classification perfectly agree with the photometric classification. We show that the detected correlation between v sin i and frequencies has nothing to do with rotational modulation of the stars but is related to their stellar pulsations. Our sample and frequency determinations offer a good starting point for seismic modelling of slow to moderately rotating {$\gamma$} Dor stars.},

For a limited set of about a dozen red giants, the observed oscillation frequencies obtained by peak-bagging together with the most recent pulsation codes allowed us to reliably determine the core/envelope rotation ratio. The results so far show that the current models are unable to reproduce the rotation ratios, predicting higher values than what is observed and thus indicating that an efficient angular momentum transport mechanism should be at work. Here we provide an asteroseismic analysis of a sample of 13 low-luminosity low-mass red giant stars observed by Kepler during its first nominal mission. These targets form a subsample of the 19 red giants studied previously, which not only have a large number of extracted oscillation frequencies, but also unambiguous mode identifications.},

From an analysis of the Kepler long cadence time series, we find that the light curve of KIC 6462033 is dominated by three modes with frequencies f1 = 0.92527, f2 = 2.03656 and f3 = 1.42972 d{\`A}1 as well as we detect more than a few hundreds of combination terms.

  abstract = {Methods. We compile a database of physical parameters for the sample stars from the literature and new ground-based observations. We analyse the Kepler light curve of each star and extract the pulsational frequencies using different frequency analysis methods. We construct two new observables, ``energy'' and ``efficiency'', related to the driving energy of the pulsation mode and the convective efficiency of the outer convective zone, respectively.
Results. We propose three main groups to describe the observed variety in pulsating A-F type stars: {$\gamma$} Dor, {$\delta$} Sct, and hybrid stars. We assign 63\% of our sample to one of the three groups, and identify the remaining part as rotationally modulated/active stars, binaries, stars of different spectral type, or stars that show no clear periodic variability. 23\% of the stars (171 stars) are hybrid stars, which is a much higher fraction than what has been observed before. We characterize for the first time a large number of A-F type stars (475 stars) in terms of number of detected frequencies, frequency range, and typical pulsation amplitudes. The majority of hybrid stars show frequencies with all kinds of periodicities within the {$\gamma$} Dor and {$\delta$} Sct range, also between 5 and 10 d-1, which is a challenge for the current models. We find indications for the existence of {$\delta$} Sct and {$\gamma$} Dor stars beyond the edges of the current observational instability strips. The hybrid stars occupy the entire region within the {$\delta$} Sct and {$\gamma$} Dor instability strips and beyond. Non-variable stars seem to exist within the instability strips. The location of {$\gamma$} Dor and {$\delta$} Sct classes in the (Teff, log g)-diagram has been extended. We investigate two newly constructed variables, ``efficiency'' and ``energy'', as a means to explore the relation between {$\gamma$} Dor and {$\delta$} Sct stars.
Conclusions. Our results suggest a revision of the current observational instability strips of {$\delta$} Sct and {$\gamma$} Dor stars and imply an investigation of pulsation mechanisms to supplement the {$\kappa$} mechanism and convective blocking effect to drive hybrid pulsations. Accurate physical parameters for all stars are needed to confirm these findings.},

  abstract = {We present a set of 87 RAVE stars with detected solar like oscillations, observed during Campaign 1 of the K2 mission (RAVE K2-C1 sample). This data set provides a useful benchmark for testing the gravities provided in RAVE data release 4 (DR4), and is key for the calibration of the RAVE data release 5 (DR5). The RAVE survey collected medium-resolution spectra (R = 7500) centred in the Ca II triplet (8600 {\AA}) wavelength interval, which although being very useful for determining radial velocity and metallicity, even at low S/N, is known be affected by a log(g)-Teff degeneracy. This degeneracy is the cause of the large spread in the RAVE DR4 gravities for giants. The understanding of the trends and offsets that affects RAVE atmospheric parameters, and in particular log(g), is a crucial step in obtaining not only improved abundance measurements, but also improved distances and ages. In the present work, we use two different pipelines, GAUFRE and Sp\_Ace, to determine atmospheric parameters and abundances by fixing log(g) to the seismic one. Our strategy ensures highly consistent values among all stellar parameters, leading to more accurate chemical abundances. A comparison of the chemical abundances obtained here with and without the use of seismic log(g) information has shown that an underestimated (overestimated) gravity leads to an underestimated (overestimated) elemental abundance (e.g. [Mg/H] is underestimated by {$\sim$}0.25 dex when the gravity is underestimated by 0.5 dex). We then perform a comparison between the seismic gravities and the spectroscopic gravities presented in the RAVE DR4 catalogue, extracting a calibration for log(g) of RAVE giants in the colour interval 0.50 {$<$} (J - KS) {$<$} 0.85. Finally, we show a comparison of the distances, temperatures, extinctions (and ages) derived here for our RAVE K2-C1 sample with those derived in RAVE DR4 and DR5. DR5 performs better than DR4 thanks to the seismic calibration, although discrepancies can still be important for objects for which the difference between DR4/DR5 and seismic gravities differ by more than {$\sim$}0.5 dex. The method illustrated in this work will be used for analysing RAVE targets present in the other K2 campaigns, in the framework of Galactic Archaeology investigations.},

This is the third brightest confirmed planet host star in the Kepler field and one of the brightest hosts of all currently known transiting exoplanets. Kepler-410 consists of a blend between the fast rotating planet host star (Kepler-410A) and a fainter star (Kepler-410B), which has complicated the confirmation of the planetary candidate. Employing asteroseismology, using constraints from the transit light curve, adaptive optics and speckle images, and Spitzer transit observations, we demonstrate that the candidate can only be an exoplanet orbiting Kepler-410A. We determine via asteroseismology the following stellar and planetary parameters with high precision; M = 1.214 {$\pm$} 0.033 M , R = 1.352 {$\pm$} 0.010 R , age = 2.76 {$\pm$} 0.54 Gyr, planetary radius (2.838 {$\pm$} 0.054 R{$\oplus$}), and orbital eccentricity (0.17+-00..0076). In addition, rotational splitting of the pulsation modes allows for a measurement of Kepler-410A's inclination and rotation rate. Our measurement of an inclination of 82.5+-72..55 [{$\smwhtcircle$}] indicates a low obliquity in this system.

Here, we investigate the presence, location, and shape of such a valley using a small sample with highly accurate stellar parameters determined from asteroseismology, which includes 117 planets with a median uncertainty on the radius of 3.3 per cent. We detect a clear bimodal distribution, with super-Earths ({$\approx$}1.5 R{$\oplus$}) and sub-Neptunes ({$\approx$}2.5 R{$\oplus$}) separated by a deficiency around 2 R{$\oplus$}. We furthermore characterize the slope of the valley as a power law R{$\propto$}P{$\gamma$} with {$\gamma$} = -0.09+-00..0024. A negative slope is consistent with models of photoevaporation, but not with the late formation of rocky planets in a gas-poor environment, which would lead to a slope of opposite sign. The exact location of the gap further points to planet cores consisting of a significant fraction of rocky material.},

We found fourteen binaries, among which are four single-lined binaries, five double-lined binaries, two triple systems, and three binaries with no detected radial velocity variations. We estimated the orbital parameters whenever possible. For the single stars and the single-lined binaries, fundamental parameter values were determined from spectroscopy. We searched for period spacing patterns in the photometric data and identified this diagnostic for 50 of the stars in the sample, 46 of which are single stars or single-lined binaries. We found a strong correlation between the spectroscopic v sin i and the period spacing values, confirming the influence of rotation on {$\gamma$} Dor-type pulsations as predicted by theory.

Disadvantages of the technique are also discussed, and include the disability to distinguish between different values of the spherical degree and azimuthal order of the oscillation modes without additional theoretical modelling.
Conclusions. Despite the shortcomings, the method is shown to allow solid detections of period spacings for {$\gamma$} Doradus stars, which will allow future asteroseismic analyses of these stars.},

  abstract = {Methods. We combined the asymptotic period spacing with the traditional approximation of stellar pulsation to fit the observed period spacing patterns using {$\chi$}2-optimisation. The method was applied to the observed period spacing patterns of a sample of stars and used for ensemble modelling.
Results. For the majority of stars with an observed period spacing pattern we successfully determined the rotation rates and the asymptotic period spacing values, although the uncertainty margins on the latter were typically large. This also resulted directly in the identification of the modes that correspond to the detected pulsation frequencies, which for most stars were prograde dipole gravity and gravito-inertial modes. The majority of the observed retrograde modes were found to be Rossby modes. We also discuss the limitations of the method that are due to the neglect of the centrifugal force and the incomplete treatment of the Coriolis force.
Conclusions. Despite its current limitations, the proposed method was successful to derive the rotation rates and to identify the modes from the observed period spacing patterns. It forms the first step towards detailed seismic modelling based on observed period spacing patterns of moderately to rapidly rotating {$\gamma$} Dor stars.},

  volume = {618},
  issn = {0004-6361, 1432-0746},
  abstract = {Methods. We have derived a new asymptotic description which accounts for the impact of weak differential near-core rotation on gravity-mode period spacings. The theoretical predictions are illustrated from pulsation computations with the code GYRE and compared with observations of {$\gamma$} Dor stars. When possible, we also derived the surface rotation rates in these stars by detecting and analysing signatures of rotational modulation, and computed the core-to-surface rotation ratios.
Results. Stellar rotation must be strongly differential before its effects on period spacing patterns can be detected, unless multiple period spacing patterns can be compared. Six stars in our sample exhibit a single unexplained period spacing pattern of retrograde modes. We hypothesise that these are Yanai modes. Finally, we find signatures of rotational spot modulation in the photometric data of eight targets.
Conclusions. If only one period spacing pattern is detected and analysed for a star, it is difficult to detect differential rotation. A rigidly rotating model will often provide the best solution. Differential rotation can only be detected when multiple period spacing patterns have been found for a single star or its surface rotation rate is known as well. This is the case for eight of the stars in our sample, revealing surface-to-core rotation ratios between 0.95 and 1.05.},

  abstract = {The advent of space-based observatories such as Convection, Rotation and planetary Transits (CoRoT) and Kepler has enabled the testing of our understanding of stellar evolution on thousands of stars. Evolutionary models typically require five input parameters, the mass, initial helium abundance, initial metallicity, mixing length (assumed to be constant over time), and the age to which the star must be evolved. Some of these parameters are also very useful in characterizing the associated planets and in studying Galactic archaeology. How to obtain these parameters from observations rapidly and accurately, specifically in the context of surveys of thousands of stars, is an outstanding question, one that has eluded straightforward resolution. For a given star, we typically measure the effective temperature and surface metallicity spectroscopically and low-degree oscillation frequencies through space observatories. Here we demonstrate that statistical learning, using artificial neural networks, is successful in determining the evolutionary parameters based on spectroscopic and seismic measurements. Our trained networks show robustness over a broad range of parameter space, and critically, are entirely computationally inexpensive and fully automated. We analyse the observations of a few stars using this method and the results compare well to inferences obtained using other techniques. This method is both computationally cheap and inferentially accurate, paving the way for analysing the vast quantities of stellar observations from past, current, and future missions.},

  title = {Helium Abundance in a Sample of Cool Stars: Measurements from Asteroseismology},
  abstract = {The structural stratification of a star primarily depends on its mass and chemical composition. The surface heavy element abundances of the solar-type stars are reasonably well determined using conventional spectroscopy, however the second most abundant element helium is not. This is due to the fact that the envelope temperature of such stars is not high enough to excite helium. Since the helium abundance of a star affects its structure and subsequent evolution, the uncertainty in the helium abundance of a star makes estimates of its global properties (mass, radius, age etc.) uncertain as well. The detections of the signatures of the acoustic glitches from the precisely measured stellar oscillation frequencies provide an indirect way to estimate the envelope helium content. We use the glitch signature caused by the ionization of helium to determine the envelope helium abundance of 38 stars in the Kepler seismic LEGACY sample. Our results confirm that atomic diffusion does indeed take place in solar-type stars. We use the measured surface abundances in combination with the settling predicted by the stellar models to determine the initial abundances. The initial helium and metal mass fractions have subsequently been used to get the preliminary estimates of the primordial helium abundance, Yp = 0.244 {$\pm$} 0.019, and the galactic enrichment ratio, {$\increment$}Y /{$\increment$}Z = 1.226 {$\pm$} 0.849. Although the current estimates have large errorbars due to the limited sample size, this method holds great promises to determine these parameters precisely in the era of upcoming space missions.},

The photometric observations are analysed using the methods developed by nine independent research teams. The results are combined to validate the determined global asteroseismic parameters and calculate the relative precision by which the parameters can be obtained. We correlate the relative number of detected solar-like oscillators with stellar parameters from the Kepler Input Catalogue and find a deficiency for stars with effective temperatures in the range 5300 Teff 5700 K and a drop-off in detected oscillations in stars approaching the red edge of the classical instability strip. We compare the power-law relationships between the frequency of peak power, {$\nu$}max, the mean large frequency separation, {$\nu$}, and the maximum mode amplitude, Amax, and show that there are significant method-dependent differences in the results obtained.

Stars that are more photometrically variable in quiescence tend to emit relatively more energy during flares, but variability is only weakly correlated with flare frequency.

Supporting infrared observations were made with the Michigan Infrared Combiner (MIRC) and Classic beam combiner, also at the CHARA Array. We find limb-darkened angular diameters of 0.753 {$\pm$} 0.009 mas for \texttheta{} Cyg, 0.539 {$\pm$} 0.007 mas for 16 Cyg A and 0.490 {$\pm$} 0.006 mas for 16 Cyg B. The Kepler Mission has observed these stars with outstanding photometric precision, revealing the presence of solar-like oscillations. Due to the brightness of these stars the oscillations have exceptional signal-to-noise, allowing for detailed study through asteroseismology, and are well constrained by other observations. We have combined our interferometric diameters with Hipparcos parallaxes, spectrophotometric bolometric fluxes and the asteroseismic large frequency separation to measure linear radii (\texttheta{} Cyg: 1.48 {$\pm$} 0.02 R , 16 Cyg A: 1.22 {$\pm$} 0.02 R , 16 Cyg B: 1.12 {$\pm$} 0.02 R ), effective temperatures (\texttheta{} Cyg: 6749 {$\pm$} 44 K, 16 Cyg A: 5839 {$\pm$} 42 K, 16 Cyg B: 5809 {$\pm$} 39 K) and masses (\texttheta{} Cyg: 1.37 {$\pm$} 0.04 M , 16 Cyg A: 1.07 {$\pm$} 0.05 M , 16 Cyg B: 1.05 {$\pm$} 0.04 M ) for each star with very little model dependence. The measurements presented here will provide strong constraints for future stellar modelling efforts.},

  abstract = {Binary star systems are important for understanding stellar structure and evolution, and are especially useful when oscillations can be detected and analysed with asteroseismology. However, only four systems are known in which solar-like oscillations are detected in both components. Here, we analyse the fifth such system, HD 176465, which was observed by Kepler. We carefully analysed the system's power spectrum to measure individual mode frequencies, adapting our methods where necessary to accommodate the fact that both stars oscillate in a similar frequency range. We also modelled the two stars independently by fitting stellar models to the frequencies and complementary parameters. We are able to cleanly separate the oscillation modes in both systems. The stellar models produce compatible ages and initial compositions for the stars, as is expected from their common and contemporaneous origin. Combining the individual ages, the system is about 3.0 {$\pm$} 0.5 Gyr old. The two components of HD 176465 are young physicallysimilar oscillating solar analogues, the first such system to be found, and provide important constraints for stellar evolution and asteroseismology.},

  abstract = {Stellar distance is an important basic parameter in stellar astrophysics. Stars in a cluster are thought to be formed coevally from the same interstellar cloud of gas and dust; therefore, they are expected to have common properties. These common properties strengthen our ability to constrain theoretical models and/or to determine fundamental parameters, such as stellar mass, metal fraction, and distance, when tested against an ensemble of cluster stars. Here we derive a new relation based on solar-like oscillations, photometric observations, and the theory of stellar structure and evolution of red giant branch stars to determine cluster distance moduli through the global oscillation parameters {$\Delta\nu$} and {$\nu$}max and photometric data V. The values of {$\Delta\nu$} and {$\nu$}max are derived from Kepler observations. At the same time, it is used to interpret the trends between V and {$\Delta\nu$}. From the analyses of this newly derived relation and observational data of NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, we devise a method in which all stars in a cluster are regarded as one entity to determine the cluster distance modulus. This approach fully reflects the characteristic of member stars in a cluster as a natural sample. From this method we derive true distance moduli of 13.09 {$\pm$} 0.10 mag for NGC 6791 and 11.88 {$\pm$} 0.14 mag for NGC 6819. Additionally, we find that the distance modulus only slightly depends on the metallicity [Fe/H] in the new relation. A change of 0.1 dex in [Fe/H] will lead to a change of 0.06 mag in the distance modulus.},

  abstract = {Asteroseismology is a powerful tool for probing stellar interiors, determining stellar fundamental parameters, and also for investigating the relational physical processes in stellar evolutions. For fast rotational slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars, the oscillation modes are split into a large frequency range and divided into many groups. For many of such stars, just one or few groups are resolved and observed in power spectra. Therefore, it becomes difficult to decided the degrees and azimuthal orders for those observed modes. In this letter, we analyze six fast rotational SPB stars which are observed by Kepler satellite: KIC 3459297, 4930889, 6352430 A, 7760680, 9020774, and KIC 11971405. We adopt a method of fitting the period spacings with a linear function to analyze the observed possible prograde order modes. Finally, combining the fitting results with the asymptotic theory of stellar oscillation about period spacings and rotational splits, we decide the degrees and azimuthal orders of the observations and determine their rotational splits and average period spacings.},

We also take into account the influence of model precision. Finally, we find that the time resolution of stellar evolution cannot be ignored in high-precision asteroseismic analysis. Based on this, we find the acoustic radius t0 is the only global parameter that can be accurately measured by the cn2-matching method between observed frequencies and theoretical model calculations. We obtain t0 = 4601.5-+84..34 s. In addition, we analyze the distribution of cn2-minimization models (CMMs) and find that the distribution range of CMMs is slightly enlarged by some extreme cases, which possess both a larger mass and a higher (or lower) heavy element abundance, at the lower acoustic radius end.},

  abstract = {Obtaining accurate and precise masses and ages for large numbers of giant stars is of great importance for unraveling the assemblage history of the Galaxy. In this paper, we estimate masses and ages of 6940 red giant branch (RGB) stars with asteroseismic parameters deduced from Kepler photometry and stellar atmospheric parameters derived from LAMOST spectra. The typical uncertainties of mass is a few per cent, and that of age is {$\sim$}20 per cent. The sample stars reveal two separate sequences in the age\textendash{}[{$\alpha$}/Fe] relation \textendash{} a high-{$\alpha$} sequence with stars older than {$\sim$}8 Gyr and a low-{$\alpha$} sequence composed of stars with ages ranging from younger than 1 Gyr to older than 11 Gyr. We further investigate the feasibility of deducing ages and masses directly from LAMOST spectra with a machine learning method based on kernel based principal component analysis, taking a sub-sample of these RGB stars as a training data set. We demonstrate that ages thus derived achieve an accuracy of {$\sim$}24 per cent. We also explored the feasibility of estimating ages and masses based on the spectroscopically measured carbon and nitrogen abundances. The results are quite satisfactory and significantly improved compared to the previous studies.},

A formula is proposed to achieve the estimation. The values of the radius of the convective core of four known stars are successfully estimated by the formula. The radius of the convective core of KIC 9812850 estimated by the formula is 0.140{$\pm$}0.028 Re. In order to confirm this prediction, a grid of evolutionary models was computed. The value of the convective-core radius of the best-fit model of KIC 9812850 is 0.149 Re, which is in good agreement with that estimated by the formula from observed frequencies. The formula aids in understanding the interior structure of stars directly from observed frequencies. The understanding is not dependent on the construction of models.},

The ratios r01 and r10 of the frequency separations of p modes with inner turning points that are located in the overshooting region of convective core can exhibit an increasing behaviour.

We report the discovery of 626 new oscillating red giants in our sample, in addition to 897 oscillators that were previously characterized by Hekker et al. from one quarter of Kepler data. Our sample increases the known number of oscillating low-luminosity red giants by 26 per cent (up to {$\sim$}1900 stars). About three quarters of our sample are classified as ascending red giant branch stars, while the remainder are red-clump stars. A novel scheme was applied to determine {$\nu$} for 108 stars with {$\nu$}max close to the Nyquist frequency (240 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz {$<$} {$\nu$}max {$<$} 320 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz). Additionally, we identified 47 stars oscillating in the super-Nyquist frequency regime, up to 387 {$\mathrm{\mu}$}Hz, using long-cadence light curves. We show that the misclassifications are most likely due to large uncertainties in KIC surface gravities, and do not result from the absence of broad-band colours or from different physical properties such as reddening, spatial distribution, mass or metallicity. The sample will be valuable to study oscillations in low-luminosity red giants and to characterize planet candidates around those stars.},

In this letter we predicted for dwarfs and giants the jitter due to stellar oscillations, which in velocity have much larger amplitudes than noise introduced by granulation. We then fitted the jitter in terms of the following sets of stellar parameters: (1) Luminosity, mass, and effective temperature: the fit returns precisions (i.e. standard deviations of fractional residuals) of 17.9 and 27.1 per cent for dwarfs and giants, respectively. (2) Luminosity, effective temperature, and surface gravity: the precisions are the same as using the previous parameter set. (3) Surface gravity and effective temperature: we obtain a precision of 22.6 per cent for dwarfs and 27.1 per cent for giants. (4) Luminosity and effective temperature: the precision is 47.8 per cent for dwarfs and 27.5 per cent for giants. Our method will be valuable for anticipating the radial-velocity stellar noise level of exoplanet host stars to be found by the TESS and PLATO space missions, and thus can be useful for their follow-up spectroscopic observations.

We measure the rotation periods of 24 heartbeat systems, using the Kepler light curves to identify rotation peaks in the Fourier transform. Where possible, we compare the rotation period to the pseudosynchronization period derived by Hut. Few of our heartbeat stars are pseudosynchronized with the orbital period. For four systems, we were able to identify two sets of rotation peaks, which we interpret as the rotation from both stars in the binary. Most stars in our sample have rotation rates larger than the pseudosynchronization period while a single target rotates much faster than this rate. The majority of the systems have a rotation period that is approximately 3 times the pseudosynchronization period, suggesting that other physical mechanisms strongly influence the sta2r's evolution.},

  abstract = {In clustered environments, stellar encounters can liberate planets from their host stars via close encounters. Although the detection probability of planets suggests that the planet population in open clusters resembles that in the field, only dozens of planet-hosting stars have been discovered in open clusters. We explore the survival rates of planets against stellar encounters in open clusters similar to the Pleiades, Hyades, and Praesepe and embedded clusters. We perform a series of N-body simulations of high-density and low-density open clusters, open clusters that grow via mergers of subclusters, and embedded clusters. We semi-analytically calculate the survival rate of planets in star clusters up to \textasciitilde{}1 Gyr using relative velocities, masses, and impact parameters of intruding stars. Less than 1.5\% of close-in planets within 1 AU and at most 7\% of planets with 1--10 AU are ejected by stellar encounters in clustered environments after the dynamical evolution of star clusters. If a planet population from 0.01--100 AU in an open cluster initially follows the probability distribution function of exoplanets discovered in the field by RV surveys with semi-major axis (\$a\_\{\textbackslash{}rm p\}\$) between 0.03--3 AU (\$\textbackslash{}propto a\_\{\textbackslash{}rm p\}\^\{-0.6\}\$), the PDF of surviving planets beyond \textasciitilde{}10 AU in open clusters follows \$\textbackslash{}propto a\_\{\textbackslash{}rm p\}\^\{-0.76\}\$, which is consistent with the result of direct-imaging surveys. The production rate of free-floating planets (FFPs) per star is 0.0096--0.18, where we assume that all the stars initially have one giant planet with a mass of 1--13 \$M\_\{\textbackslash{}rm Jup\}\$ in a circular orbit. The expected frequency of FFPs is compatible with the upper limit on that of FFPs indicated by recent microlensing surveys.},

  abstract = {We study the accuracy of spectroscopic RVs by comparing spectroscopic and astrometric RVs for stars of the Hyades open cluster. Rather accurate astrometric RVs are available for the Hyades' stars, based on Hipparcos and on the first Gaia data release. We obtained HARPS spectra for a large sample of Hyades stars, and homogeneously analysed them. After cleaning the sample from binaries, RV variables, and outliers, 71 stars remained. The distribution of the observed RV difference (spectroscopic -- astrometric) is skewed and depends on the star right ascension. This is consistent with the Hyades cluster rotating at 42.3 +/- 10 m/s/pc. The two Hyades giants in the sample show, as predicted by gravitational redshift (GR), a spectroscopic RV that is blue-shifted with respect to the dwarfs, and the empirical GR slope is of 626 +/- 131 m/s, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. The difference between spectroscopic and astrometric RVs is very close to zero, within the uncertainties. In particular, the mean difference is of -33 m/s and the median is of -16 m/s when considering the Gaia-based RVs (corrected for cluster rotation), with a sigma of 347 m/s, very close to the expected cluster velocity dispersion. We also determine a new value of the cluster centroid spectroscopic RV: 39.36 +/- 0.26 km/s. The spectroscopic RV measurements are expected, from simulations, to depend on stellar rotation, but our data do not confirm these predictions. We finally discuss other phenomena that can influence the RV difference, such as cluster expansion, stellar activity, general relativity, and Galactic potential. Clusters within the reach of current telescopes are expected to show differences of several hundreds m/s, depending on their position in the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {We present a timing analysis of the eclipsing post-common envelope binary (PCEB) DE CVn. Based on new CCD photometric observations and the published data, we found that the orbital period in DE CVn has a cyclic period oscillation with an amplitude of \$28.08\$ s and a period of \$11.22\$ years plus a rapid period decrease at a rate of \$\textbackslash{}dot\{P\}=-3.35\textbackslash{}times10\^\{-11\}ss\^\{-1\}\$. According to the evolutionary theory, secular period decreases in PCEBs arise from angular momentum losses (AMLs) driven by gravitational radiation (GR) and magnetic braking (MB). However, the observed orbital decay is too fast to be produced by AMLs via GR and MB, indicating that there could be other AML mechanism. We suggest that a circumbinary disk around DE CVn may be responsible for the additional AML. The disk mass was derived as a few\$\textbackslash{}times\$\$10\^\{-4\}\$-\$10\^\{-3\}\$\$M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\$ , which is in agreement with that inferred from previous studies in the order of magnitude. The cyclic change is most likely result of the gravitational perturbation by a circumbinary object due to the Applegate's mechanism fails to explain such a large period oscillation. The mass of the potential third body is calculated as \$M\_\{3\}\textbackslash{}sin\{i'\}=0.011(\textbackslash{}pm0.003)M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\$. Supposing the circumbinary companion and the eclipsing binary is coplanar, its mass would correspond to a giant planet. This hypothetical giant planet is moving in a circular orbit of radius \$\textbackslash{}sim5.75(\textbackslash{}pm2.02)\$ AU around its host star.},

  abstract = {We report on a first census of Galactic black hole X-ray binary (BHXRB) properties with the second data release (DR2) of \{\textbackslash{}em Gaia\}, focusing on dynamically confirmed and strong candidate black hole transients. DR2 provides five-parameter astrometric solutions including position, parallax and proper motion for 11 of a sample of 24 systems. Distance estimates are tested with parallax inversion as well as Bayesian inference. We derive an empirically motivated characteristic scale length of \$L\$=2.17\$\textbackslash{}pm\$0.12 kpc for this BHXRB population to infer distances based upon an exponentially decreasing space density prior. Geometric DR2 parallaxes provide new, independent distance estimates, but the faintness of this population in quiescence results in relatively large fractional distance uncertainties. Despite this, DR2 estimates generally agree with literature distances. The most discrepant case is BW Cir, for which detailed studies of the donor star have suggested a distant location at \$\textbackslash{}sim\$25 kpc. A large DR2 measured parallax and relatively high proper motion instead prefer significantly smaller distances, suggesting that the source may instead be amongst the nearest of XRBs. However, both distances create problems for interpretation of the source, and follow-up data are required to resolve its true nature. DR2 also provides a first distance estimate to one source, MAXI J1820+070, and novel proper motion estimates for 7 sources. Peculiar velocities relative to Galactic rotation exceed \$\textbackslash{}approx\$50 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ for the bulk of the sample, with a median system kinetic energy of peculiar motion of \$\textbackslash{}sim\$5\$\textbackslash{}times\$10\$\^\{47\}\$erg. BW Cir could be a new high-velocity BHXRB if its astrometry is confirmed. A putative anti-correlation between system kinetic energy and black hole mass is found, though not yet constrained enough to distinguish BH formation channels.},

  abstract = {SN 1572 (Tycho Brahe's supernova) clearly belongs to the Ia (thermonuclear) type. It was produced by the explosion of a white dwarf in a binary system. Its remnant has been the first of this type to be explored in search of a possible surviving companion, the mass donor that brought the white dwarf to the point of explosion. A high peculiar motion with respect to the stars at the same location in the Galaxy, mainly due to the orbital velocity at the time of the explosion, is a basic criterion for the detection of such companions. Radial velocities from the spectra of the stars close to the geometrical center of Tycho's supernova remnant, plus proper motions of the same stars, obtained by astrometry with the \{\textbackslash{}it Hubble Space Telescope\}, have been used so far. In addition, a detailed chemical analysis of the atmospheres of a sample of candidate stars had been made. However, the distances to the stars, remained uncertain. Now, the Second \{\textbackslash{}it Gaia\} Data Release (DR2) provides unprecedent accurate distances and new proper motions for the stars can be compared with those made from the \{\textbackslash{}it HST\}. We consider the Galactic orbits that the candidate stars to SN companion would have in the future. We do this to explore kinematic peculiarity. We also locate a representative sample of candidate stars in the Toomre diagram.

Bias-free results are required.\emph{Methods.\emph{We use methods of stellar statistics and develop a semi-empirical model of open clusters.\emph{Results.\emph{We check two effects impacting the determination of tidal radii from a fitting of King's profiles to the observed density distribution, i.e., ellipticity of open clusters and a bias depending on distances. Though a typical cluster has an elliptical form, the effect is rather weak to produce a prominent bias in the resulting tidal radii. In contrast, a distance dependent bias is not negligible and can cause a systematic underestimation of tidal radii computed with ASCC-2.5 data by a factor of two for the most distant clusters of our sample. This finding is used to correct the original results for 236 clusters and to extend the system of tidal radii and masses to all 650 clusters. We found that the semi-major axis of the projected distribution of cluster members on the sky is a parameter suited to estimate tidal radii of open clusters of our sample. No systematic differences are found between measured and calibrated tidal radii. From the comparison with mass estimates based on star counts and on the assumption of the Salpeter IMF, empirical evidence is obtained for an evolution of cluster mass functions starting in young clusters.\emph{Conclusions.\emph{The set of homogeneous parameters available for all clusters of our sample is extended by tidal radius and mass. Within 850 pc where our sample is complete, the distributions of tidal radii and masses peak at pc and , respectively. In young open clusters, the mass distributions show differences to the Salpeter IMF, and this discrepancy increases with cluster age.}}}}}}}}}}},

They will appear as variable stars with characteristics that are of much diagnostic value to astronomers. The analysis of such observations provides a challenging and unique approach to study aspects of the internal constitution and evolutionary status of these objects that are not accessible otherwise. This review touches on most classes of known pulsating variable stars and tries to elucidate connections to stellar physical aspects.

This review presents a summary of the available techniques for age-dating stars and ensembles of stars, their realms of applicability, and their strengths and weaknesses. My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is described. Although our present ability to determine the ages of even the nearest stars is mediocre, the next few years hold great promise as asteroseismology probes beyond stellar surfaces and starts to provide precise interior properties of stars and as models continue to improve when stressed by better observations.},

This has followed from the apparent homogeneity of the group, the large number present in the Galaxy, and their moderately high luminosities, which render them visible at large distances. However, in the past decade it has become clear that RR Lyrae stars are heterogeneous in many observable parameters. This heterogeneity limits their usefulness in some contexts and enhances their value in others. In addition to their applications in galactic research, the RR Lyrae stars are of current astrophysical interest on account of the line-doubling and emission that occur during rising light, the multiple periodicities found in many of them, and various other phase- and period-dependent phenomena that bear on the theory of stellar pulsation.

Because the RC is easily recognizable within the data of large spectroscopic and asteroseismic surveys, it is a useful probe of stellar densities, kinematics, and chemical abundances across the Milky Way disk; it can be applied up to larger distances than that allowed by dwarfs; and it has better accuracy than is possible with other kinds of giants. Here, we discuss the reasons for the RC narrowness in several sets of observational data, its fine structure, and the presence of systematic changes in the RC properties as regards age, metallicity, and the observed passband.

Evidence shows that the period-color and period-luminosity (P-L) relations for population I Cepheids in the Galaxy and in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds have different slopes and zero points. This greatly complicates use of Cepheids for the extragalactic distance scale. Strategies are discussed to patch the problem. A consensus exists for the long distance scale for RR Lyrae stars whose calibrations favor {$\langle$}MV(RR){$\rangle$} = 0.52 at [Fe/H] = -1.5. Exceptions exist for ``second parameter'' clusters where the variation of the morphology of the horizontal branch with metallicity is anomalous, the most blatant being NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. The status and calibrations of ABH1 and AC show that different evolutionary paths and masses explain the difference P-L relations for them. AC appear predominantly in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies, but are almost absent in Galactic globular clusters. AHB1 stars are absent in dwarf spheroidals but are present in globular clusters. The difference may be used to study the formation of the remote Galactic halo if it is partially made by tidal disruption of companion dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract = {Six SX Phe variables detected in a 39 hr time series of Hubble Space Telescope Planetary Camera exposures in the F336W (U) filter are discussed. Two of these stars show both the fundamental and
first-overtone modes and are among the first double-mode SX Phe stars reported in globular clusters. One of the double-mode stars shows evidence for a third mode near the expected period for the second overtone. Two of the other SX Phe variables in 47 Tuc are shown to oscillate simultaneously in the fourth and fifth radial overtones. The remaining two variables both have multiple oscillations excited which include nonradial modes. To support interpretation of these variables we provide evolutionary computations using current opacities and physics allowing comparison of the blue straggler stars (BSSs) and several cluster-magnitude diagram features for 47 Tuc. Linear nonadiabatic oscillation analysis is performed for a significant range of envelope and full evolutionary models in order to (1) establish the theoretical characteristics of SX Phe pulsations (e.g., location of primary driving and adiabatic nature), (2) establish the theoretical red and blue edges of the instability strip, and (3) derive the theoretical relations necessary for obtaining evolutionary and pulsational masses. Masses inferred from fundamental period-period ratio relations for the
double-mode oscillators are well above the turnoff mass in 47 Tucanae and are consistent with expected masses for these blue stragglers based on position in the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and comparison with theoretical evolutionary tracks. Combining the evolution and pulsation constraints results in mass estimates for the four double-mode BSSs in 47 Tuc of M = 1.35 +/- 0.1 to 1.6 +/- 0.2 M{$\odot$}.

support of the core Kepler mission of characterizing detected planets
follows from stellar radius determinations needed to in turn provide
radii for the planets. The steps from processing of Kepler short cadence
data, derivation of asteroseismic frequencies from power spectra of
these time series, constraint on the mean stellar density and ultimately
stellar radius will be illustrated for a few planet host stars yielding
radii to accuracies approaching 1\%. Analysis of individual oscillation
frequencies will provide information about the properties of stellar
interiors, resulting in some cases in determinations of ages to about
10\%. Asteroseismic results will ultimately be expected for several
thousand stars ranging from the solar analog oscillations mentioned

  abstract = {The Kepler Mission offers two options for observations\textemdash{}either long cadence (LC) used for the bulk of core mission science, or short cadence (SC) which is used for applications such as asteroseismology of
solar-like stars and transit timing measurements of exoplanets where the 1 minute sampling is critical. We discuss the characteristics of SC data obtained in the 33.5 day long Quarter 1 observations with Kepler which completed on 2009 June 15. The truly excellent time series precisions are nearly Poisson limited at 11th magnitude providing per-point measurement errors of 200 parts-per-million per minute. For extremely saturated stars near seventh magnitude precisions of 40 ppm are reached, while for background limited measurements at 17th magnitude precisions of 7 mmag are maintained. We note the presence of two additive
artifacts, one that generates regularly spaced peaks in frequency, and one that involves additive offsets in the time domain inversely
proportional to stellar brightness. The difference between LC and SC sampling is illustrated for transit observations of TrES-2.},

  title = {Asteroseismology of {{Cool Dwarfs}} and {{Giants}} with {{Kepler}}},
  volume = {448},
  abstract = {The primary science goal of the Kepler Mission is to detect planets in the habitable zones of their host stars where liquid water could exist on the planet surface, and to determine the intrinsic frequency of these and other exoplanets. The technique employed by Kepler is to search for shallow transits, that in the case of a true Earth analog would be 85 parts per million deep, lasting an average of 10 hours, and happening once per year. This combination of small, short, and rare events drives mission development and operations to support ultra-high precision photometry on one field of 150,000 largely solar-like stars with nearly continuous exposures covering at least 3.5 years. Since the transit depth returns only the size of a candidate planet relative to the size of its host star, fulfillment of an additional Kepler science goal of determining physical properties of the discovered planets requires us to also determine stellar properties, with stellar radius being the most important. For the latter asteroseismology is a particularly important tool that allows stellar radii to be determined to \texttildelow{}1\% in
favorable cases.

The Kepler asteroseismology program is organized into a large
international collaboration - the Kepler Asteroseismic Science
Consortium consisting of a dozen working groups and some 300 members. The observations to date in the area of cool giant stars consist of 30 minute integrations for some 1,200 stars spanning a full year. For cool dwarfs the observations to date using 1 minute integrations aimed at asteroseismology consist of three types: (1) A few thousand stars observed for one month each in a "survey" mode to identify the best prospects for lengthier observations. (2) About 200 stars hosting planet candidates observed for periods now reaching up to a year for which asteroseismology is desired whenever possible. (3) A set of about 100 stars for which much more extended observations are possible that have been selected purely on the basis of asteroseismic interest.

The red giants have typical magnitudes of about 12th, with a couple of hundred selected at brighter magnitudes. In nearly all cases the astrophysical signatures of oscillations and granulation dominate noise sources.

Cool dwarfs studied for asteroseismology range from 16 Cyg A and B near 6th magnitude, to planet host stars of 13th magnitude for which
extensive observations may allow detection of at least the asteroseismic large separation to constrain the stellar mean density and hence radius.

I review the target selections, the instrumental capabilities relevant for cool-star asteroseismology, and the basic approaches and promises of asteroseismology. Emphasis is given to reviewing the extensive new returns from the Kepler Mission that are providing new insights into cool dwarfs and giants from asteroseismic analyses.},

  title = {Revised {{Gaia Data Release}} 2 Passbands},
  volume = {617},
  abstract = {Context. The European Space Agency mission Gaia has published, with its second data release (DR2), a catalogue of photometric measurements for more than 1.3 billion astronomical objects in three passbands. The precision of the measurements in these passbands, denoted G, G\textsubscript{BP}, and G\textsubscript{RP}, reach down to the milli-magnitude level. The scientific exploitation of this data set requires precise knowledge of the response curves of the three passbands. \\
 Aims: This work aims to improve the exploitation of the photometric data by deriving an improved set of response curves for the three passbands, allowing for an accurate computation of synthetic Gaia photometry. \\
 Methods: This is achieved by formulating the problem of passband determination in a functional analytic formalism, and linking the photometric measurements with four observational, one empirical, and one theoretical spectral library. \\
 Results: We present response curves for G, G\textsubscript{BP}, and G\textsubscript{RP} that differ from the previously published curves, and which provide a better agreement between synthetic Gaia photometry and Gaia observations.

  volume = {616},
  issn = {0004-6361},
  abstract = {Context. Gaia Data Release 2 provides high-precision astrometry and three-band photometry for about 1.3 billion sources over the full sky. The precision, accuracy, and homogeneity of both astrometry and
photometry are unprecedented. Aims: We highlight the power of the Gaia DR2 in studying many fine structures of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Gaia allows us to present many different HRDs, depending in particular on stellar population selections. We do not aim here for completeness in terms of types of stars or stellar evolutionary aspects. Instead, we have chosen several illustrative examples. Methods: We describe some of the selections that can be made in Gaia DR2 to highlight the main structures of the Gaia HRDs. We select both field and cluster (open and globular) stars, compare the observations with previous classifications and with stellar evolutionary tracks, and we present variations of the Gaia HRD with age, metallicity, and
kinematics. Late stages of stellar evolution such as hot subdwarfs, post-AGB stars, planetary nebulae, and white dwarfs are also analysed, as well as low-mass brown dwarf objects. Results: The Gaia HRDs are unprecedented in both precision and coverage of the various Milky Way stellar populations and stellar evolutionary phases. Many fine structures of the HRDs are presented. The clear split of the white dwarf sequence into hydrogen and helium white dwarfs is presented for the first time in an HRD. The relation between kinematics and the HRD is nicely illustrated. Two different populations in a classical kinematic selection of the halo are unambiguously identified in the HRD.
Membership and mean parameters for a selected list of open clusters are provided. They allow drawing very detailed cluster sequences,
highlighting fine structures, and providing extremely precise empirical isochrones that will lead to more insight in stellar physics. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 demonstrates the potential of combining precise astrometry and photometry for large samples for studies in stellar evolution and stellar population and opens an entire new area for HRD-based studies.

  abstract = {Aboriginal Australians carefully observe the properties and positions of stars, including both overt and subtle changes in their brightness, for subsistence and social application. These observations are encoded in oral tradition. I examine two Aboriginal oral traditions from South Australia that describe the periodic changing brightness in three pulsating, red-giant variable stars: Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis), Aldebaran (Alpha Tauri), and Antares (Alpha Scorpii). The Australian Aboriginal accounts stand as the only known descriptions of pulsating variable stars in any Indigenous oral tradition in the world. Researchers examining these oral traditions over the last century, including anthropologists and astronomers, missed the description of these stars as being variable in nature as the ethnographic record contained several misidentifications of stars and celestial objects. Arguably, ethnographers working on Indigenous Knowledge Systems should have academic training in both the natural and social sciences.},

  abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars that form the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. Several examples exist in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly abundant in starburst and interacting galaxies. The few YMCs that are close enough to resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and the ecological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. The distant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster mass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation mechanisms of young cluster populations. YMCs are expected to be the nurseries for many unusual objects, including a wide range of exotic stars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in YMCs, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are unusually rich in stellar exotica. In this review, we focus on star clusters younger than {$\sim$}100 Myr, more than a few current crossing times old, and more massive than {$\sim$}104M{$\odot$}; the size of the cluster and its environment are considered less relevant as distinguishing parameters. We describe the global properties of the currently known young massive star clusters in the Local Group and beyond, and discuss the state of the art in observations and dynamical modeling of these systems. In order to make this review readable by observers, theorists, and computational astrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary terminology.},

  abstract = {The age of an individual star cannot be measured, only estimated through mostly model-dependent or empirical methods, and no single method works well for a broad range of stellar types or for a full range in age. This review presents a summary of the available techniques for age-dating stars and ensembles of stars, their realms of applicability, and their strengths and weaknesses. My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is described. Although our present ability to determine the ages of even the nearest stars is mediocre, the next few years hold great promise as asteroseismology probes beyond stellar surfaces and starts to provide precise interior properties of stars and as models continue to improve when stressed by better observations.},

  abstract = {Globular clusters (GCs) exhibit star-to-star variations in specific elements (e.g., He, C, N, O, Na, Al) that bear the hallmark of high-temperature H-burning. These abundance variations can be observed spectroscopically and also photometrically, with the appropriate choice of filters, due to the changing of spectral features within the band pass. This phenomenon is observed in nearly all of the ancient GCs, although, to date, it has not been found in any massive cluster younger than 2 Gyr. Many scenarios have been suggested to explain this phenomenon, with most invoking multiple epochs of star formation within the cluster; however, all have failed to reproduce various key observations, in particular when a global view of the GC population is taken. We review the state of current observations and outline the successes and failures of each of the main proposed models. The traditional idea of using the stellar ejecta from a first generation of stars to form a second generation of stars, while conceptually straightforward, has failed to reproduce an increasing number of observational constraints. We conclude that the puzzle of multiple populations remains unsolved, hence alternative theories are needed.},

This feature has given rise to a series of methods aimed at measuring the distributions of stellar distances and extinctions, especially in the Magellanic Clouds and Milky Way Bulge. Because the RC is easily recognizable within the data of large spectroscopic and asteroseismic surveys, it is a useful probe of stellar densities, kinematics, and chemical abundances across the Milky Way disk; it can be applied up to larger distances than that allowed by dwarfs; and it has better accuracy than is possible with other kinds of giants. Here, we discuss the reasons for the RC narrowness in several sets of observational data, its fine structure, and the presence of systematic changes in the RC properties as regards age, metallicity, and the observed passband. These factors set the limits on the validity and accuracy of several RC methods defined in the literature.},

Evidence shows that the period-color and period-luminosity (P-L) relations for population I Cepheids in the Galaxy and in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds have different slopes and zero points. This greatly complicates use of Cepheids for the extragalactic distance scale. Strategies are discussed to patch the problem. A consensus exists for the long distance scale for RR Lyrae stars whose calibrations favor {$\langle$}MV(RR){$\rangle$} = 0.52 at [Fe/H] = -1.5. Exceptions exist for ``second parameter'' clusters where the variation of the morphology of the horizontal branch with metallicity is anomalous, the most blatant being NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. The status and calibrations of ABH1 and AC show that different evolutionary paths and masses explain the difference P-L relations for them. AC appear predominantly in the dwarf spheroidal galaxies, but are almost absent in Galactic globular clusters. AHB1 stars are absent in dwarf spheroidals but are present in globular clusters. The difference may be used to study the formation of the remote Galactic halo if it is partially made by tidal disruption of companion dwarf spheroidals.},

  abstract = {NGC 6791 is a unique stellar cluster, key to our understanding of both the multiple stellar population phenomenon and the evolution and assembly of the Galaxy. However, despite many investigations, its nature is still very controversial. Geisler et al. (2012) found evidence suggesting it was the first open cluster to possess multiple populations but several subsequent studies did not corroborate this. It has also been considered a member of the thin or thick disk or even the bulge, and both as an open or globular cluster or even the remnant of a dwarf galaxy. Here, we present and discuss detailed abundances derived from high resolution spectra obtained with UVES at VLT and HIRES at Keck of 17 evolved stars of this cluster. We obtained a mean [Fe/H]=+0.313+-0.005, in good agreement with recent estimates, and with no indication of star-to-star metallicity variation, as expected. We also did not find any variation in Na, in spite of having selected the very same stars as in Geisler et al. (2012), where a Na variation was claimed. This points to the presence of probable systematics in the lower resolution spectra of this very high metallicity cluster analysed in that work. In fact, we find no evidence for an intrinsic spread in any element, corroborating recent independent APOGEE data. The derived abundances indicate that NGC 6791 very likely formed in the Galactic Bulge and that the proposed association with the Thick Disk is unlikely, despite its present Galactic location. We confirm the most recent hypothesis suggesting that the cluster could have formed in the Bulge and radially migrated to its current location, which appears the best explanation for this intriguing object.},

  abstract = {Oscillation modes with a mixed character, as observed in evolved low-mass stars, are highly sensitive to the physical properties of the innermost regions. Measuring their properties is therefore extremely important to probe the core, but requires some care, due to the complexity of the mixed-mode pattern. This work aims at providing a consistent description of the mixed-mode pattern of low-mass stars, based on the asymptotic expansion. We also aim at studying the variation of the gravity offset \$\textbackslash{}varepsilon\_\{g\}\$ with stellar evolution. We revisit previous work about mixed modes in red giants and empirically test how period spacings, rotational splittings, mixed-mode widths and heights can be estimated in a consistent view, based on the properties of the mode inertia ratios. From the asymptotic fit of the mixed-mode pattern of a large set of red giants at various evolutionary stages, we derive unbiased and precise asymptotic parameters. As the asymptotic expansion of gravity modes is verified with a precision close to the frequency resolution for stars on the red giant branch (10\$\^\{-4\}\$ in relative values), we can derive accurate values of the asymptotic parameters. We decipher the complex pattern in a rapidly rotating star, and explain how asymmetrical splittings can be inferred, as well as the stellar inclinations. This allows us to revisit the stellar inclinations in two open clusters, NGC 6819 and NGC 6791: our results show that the stellar inclinations in these clusters do not have privileged orientation in the sky. The variation of the asymptotic gravity offset along with stellar evolution is investigated in detail. We also derive generic properties that explain under which conditions mixed modes can be observed.},

This confirms previous findings that a large fraction (about 40 percent) of A and B stars may exhibit rotational modulation. Gaia DR2 parallaxes were used to estimate luminosities, from which the radii and equatorial rotational velocities can be deduced. It is shown that observed values of the projected rotational velocities are lower than the estimated equatorial velocities for nearly all the stars, as they should be if rotation is the cause of the light variation.

  title = {Stellar Masses from Granulation and Oscillations of 23 Bright Red Giants Observed by {{BRITE}} - {{Constellation}}},
  abstract = {Context: The study of stellar structure and evolution depends crucially on accurate stellar parameters. The photometry from space telescopes has provided superb data that allowed asteroseismic characterisation of thousands of stars. However, typical targets of space telescopes are rather faint and complementary measurements are difficult to obtain. On the other hand, the brightest, otherwise well-studied stars, are lacking seismic characterization. Aims: Our goal is to use the granulation and/or oscillation time scales measured from photometric time series of bright red giants (1.6\$\textbackslash{}leq\$Vmag\$\textbackslash{}leq\$5.3) observed with BRITE to determine stellar surface gravities and masses. Methods: We use probabilistic methods to characterize the granulation and/or oscillation signal in the power density spectra and the autocorrelation function of the BRITE time series. Results: We detect a clear granulation and/or oscillation signal in 23 red giant stars and extract the corresponding time scales from the power density spectra as well as the autocorrelation function of the BRITE time series. To account for the recently discovered non-linearity of the classical seismic scaling relations, we use parameters from a large sample of Kepler stars to re-calibrate the scalings of the high- and low-frequency components of the granulation signal. We develop a method to identify which component is measured if only one granulation component is statistically significant in the data. We then use the new scalings to determine the surface gravity of our sample stars, finding them to be consistent with those determined from the autocorrelation signal of the time series. We further use radius estimates from the literature to determine the stellar masses of our sample stars from the measured surface gravities. We also define a statistical measure for the evolutionary stage of the stars.},

  abstract = {The asteroseismic modelling of period spacing patterns from gravito-inertial modes in stars with a convective core is a high-dimensional problem. We utilise the measured period spacing pattern of prograde dipole gravity modes (acquiring \$\textbackslash{}Pi\_0\$), in combination with the effective temperature (\$T\_\{\textbackslash{}rm eff\}\$) and surface gravity (\$\textbackslash{}log g\$) derived from spectroscopy, to estimate the fundamental stellar parameters and core properties of 37 \$\textbackslash{}gamma\textasciitilde\$Doradus (\$\textbackslash{}gamma\textasciitilde\$Dor) stars whose rotation frequency has been derived from \$\textbackslash{}textit\{Kepler\}\$ photometry. We make use of two 6D grids of stellar models, one with step core overshooting and one with exponential core overshooting, to evaluate correlations between the three observables \$\textbackslash{}Pi\_0\$, \$T\_\{\textbackslash{}rm eff\}\$, and \$\textbackslash{}log g\$ and the mass, age, core overshooting, metallicity, initial hydrogen mass fraction and envelope mixing. We provide multivariate linear model recipes relating the stellar parameters to be estimated to the three observables (\$\textbackslash{}Pi\_0\$, \$T\_\{\textbackslash{}rm eff\}\$, \$\textbackslash{}log g\$). We estimate the (core) mass, age, core overshooting and metallicity of \$\textbackslash{}gamma\textasciitilde\$Dor stars from an ensemble analysis and achieve relative uncertainties of \$\textbackslash{}sim\textbackslash{}!10\$ per cent for the parameters. The asteroseismic age determination allows us to conclude that efficient angular momentum transport occurs already early on during the main sequence. We find that the nine stars with observed Rossby modes occur across almost the entire main-sequence phase, except close to core-hydrogen exhaustion. Future improvements of our work will come from the inclusion of more types of detected modes per star, larger samples, and modelling of individual mode frequencies.},

  title = {Sounding Stellar Cycles with {{Kepler}} - {{III}}. {{Comparative}} Analysis of Chromospheric, Photometric and Asteroseismic Variability},
  abstract = {By combining ground-based spectrographic observations of variability in the chromospheric emission from Sun-like stars with the variability seen in their eigenmode frequencies, it is possible to relate the changes observed at the surfaces of these stars to the changes taking place in the interior. By further comparing this variability to changes in the relative flux from the stars, one can obtain an expression for how these activity indicators relate to the energy output from the stars. Such studies become very pertinent when the variability can be related to stellar cycles as they can then be used on improve our understanding of the solar cycle and its effect on the energy output from the Sun. Here we present observations of chromospheric emission in 20 Sun-like stars obtained over the course of the nominal 4-year Kepler mission. Even though 4 years is not short to detect stellar cycles, observations from the Kepler mission can still be used to analyse the variability of the different activity indicators thereby obtaining information of the physical mechanism generating the variability. The analysis reveals no strong correlation between the different activity indicators, except in very few cases. We suggest that this is due to the sparse sampling of our ground-based observations on the one hand and that we are likely not tracing cyclic variability on the other hand. We also discuss how to improve the situation.},

However, main-sequence F-type stars exhibit short mode lifetimes relative to their oscillation frequency, resulting in overlapping radial and quadrupole modes. The goal of this paper is to use the blended modes for asteroseismology in place of the individual separable modes. We used a peak-bagging method to measure the centroids of radial-quadrupole pairs for 66 stars from the \textbackslash{}textit\{Kepler\} LEGACY sample, as well as \{\textbackslash{}theta\} Cyg, HD 49933, HD 181420, and Procyon. We used the relative quadrupole-mode visibility to estimate a theoretical centroid frequency from a grid of stellar oscillation models. The observed centroids were matched to the modelled centroids with empirical surface correction to calculate stellar parameters. We find that the stellar parameters returned using this approach agree with the results using individual mode frequencies for stars, where those are available. We conclude that the unresolved centroid frequencies can be used to perform asteroseismology with an accuracy similar to that based on individual mode frequencies.},

The advantage of using high-resolution spectra in the H-band is that lines of CO are well represented and their line profiles are sensitive to the variation of 12C/13C. Values of the 12C/13C ratio were obtained from a spectrum synthesis analysis. The derived 12C/13C ratios varied between 6.3 and 10.6 in NGC 6791, in agreement with the final isotopic ratios from thermohaline-induced mixing models. The ratios derived here are combined with those obtained for more metal poor red-giants from the literature to examine the correlation between 12C/13C, mass, metallicity and evolutionary status.},

By performing an orbital analysis within a Galactic model including spiral arms and a bar, we found that it is plausible that NGC 6791 formed in the inner thin disc or in the bulge, and later displaced by radial migration to its current orbit. We apply different tools to simulate NGC 6791, including direct \$N\$-body summation in time-varying potentials, to test its survivability when going through different Galactic environments. In order to survive the 8 Gyr journey moving on a migrating orbit, NGC 6791 must have been more massive, \$M\_0 \textbackslash{}geq 5\textbackslash{}times10\^4 M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\$, when formed. We find independent confirmation of this initial mass in the stellar mass function, which is observed to be flat; this can only be explained if the average tidal field strength experienced by the cluster is stronger than what it is at its current orbit. Therefore, the birth place and journeys of NGC 6791 are imprinted in its chemical composition, in its mass loss, and in its flat stellar mass function, supporting its origin in the inner thin disc or in the bulge.},

  abstract = {Stellar clusters form by gravitational collapse of turbulent molecular
clouds, with up to several thousand stars per cluster. They are thought to be
the birthplace of most stars and therefore play an important role in our
understanding of star formation, a fundamental problem in astrophysics. The
initial conditions of the molecular cloud establish its dynamical history until
the stellar cluster is born. However, the evolution of the cloud's angular
momentum during cluster formation is not well understood. Current observations
have suggested that turbulence scrambles the angular momentum of the
cluster-forming cloud, preventing spin alignment amongst stars within a
cluster. Here we use asteroseismology to measure the inclination angles of spin
axes in 48 stars from the two old open clusters NGC\textasciitilde{}6791 and NGC\textasciitilde{}6819. The
stars within each cluster show strong alignment. Three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations of proto-cluster formation show that at least 50 \%
of the initial proto-cluster kinetic energy has to be rotational in order to
obtain strong stellar-spin alignment within a cluster. Our result indicates
that the global angular momentum of the cluster-forming clouds was efficiently
transferred to each star and that its imprint has survived after several
gigayears since the clusters formed.},

  abstract = {The effect of metallicity on the granulation activity in stars is still poorly understood. Available spectroscopic parameters from the updated APOGEE-\textbackslash{}textit\{Kepler\} catalog, coupled with high-precision photometric observations from NASA's \textbackslash{}textit\{Kepler\} mission spanning more than four years of observation, make oscillating red giant stars in open clusters crucial testbeds. We determine the role of metallicity on the stellar granulation activity by discriminating its effect from that of different stellar properties such as surface gravity, mass, and temperature. We analyze 60 known red giant stars belonging to the open clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6819, and NGC 6811, spanning a metallicity range from [Fe/H] \$\textbackslash{}simeq -0.09\$ to \$0.32\$. The parameters describing the granulation activity of these stars and their \$\textbackslash{}nu\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{max\}\$, are studied by considering the different masses, metallicities, and stellar evolutionary stages. We derive new scaling relations for the granulation activity, re-calibrate existing ones, and identify the best scaling relations from the available set of observations. We adopted the Bayesian code DIAMONDS for the analysis of the background signal in the Fourier spectra of the stars. We performed a Bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison to test the different model hypotheses proposed in this work and in the literature. Metallicity causes a statistically significant change in the amplitude of the granulation activity, with a dependency stronger than that induced by both stellar mass and surface gravity. We also find that the metallicity has a significant impact on the corresponding time scales of the phenomenon. The effect of metallicity on the time scale is stronger than that of mass. A higher metallicity increases the amplitude of granulation and meso-granulation signals and slows down their characteristic time scales toward longer periods.},

Key to this time-stamping is the cluster NGC 6791, whose stellar members have mean abundances that place it in the high-\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$, high-[Fe/H] region of the [\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane. Based on the cluster's age (\$\textbackslash{}sim 8\$ Gyr), Galactocentric radius, and height above the Galactic plane, as well as comparable chemistry reported for APOGEE stars in Baade's Window, we suggest that the two most likely origins for NGC 6791 are as an original part of the thick-disk, or as a former member of the Galactic bulge. Moreover, because NGC 6791 lies at the \textbackslash{}textit\{high metallicity end\} ([Fe/H] \$\textbackslash{}sim 0.4\$) of the high-\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$ sequence, the age of NGC 6791 places a limit on the \textbackslash{}textit\{youngest age\} of stars in the high-metallicity, high-\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$ sequence for the cluster's parent population (i.e., either the bulge or the disk). In a similar way, we can also use the age and chemistry of NGC 188 to set a limit of \$\textbackslash{}sim 7\$ Gyr on the \textbackslash{}textit\{oldest age\} of the low-\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$ sequence of the Milky Way.

Adding independent information on the stellar luminosity, these values can decrease down to 3 and 10 per cent respectively. The application of these methods to NGC 6819 giants produces a mean age in agreement with those derived from isochrone fitting, and no evidence of systematic differences between RGB and RC stars. The age dispersion of NGC 6819 stars, however, is larger than expected, with at least part of the spread ascribable to stars that underwent mass-transfer events.},

The calculations adopt a time-dependent non-local convection model, with the turbulent pressure profile being calibrated to results of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar atmospheres. The linewidths are obtained from extensive peakbagging of Kepler lightcurves. These observational results are of unprecedented quality owing to the long continuous observations by Kepler. The uniqueness of the Kepler mission also means that, for asteroseismic properties, this is the best data that will be available for a long time to come. We therefore take great care in modelling nine RGB stars in NGC 6819 using information from 3D simulations to obtain realistic temperature stratifications and calibrated turbulent pressure profiles. Our modelled damping rates reproduce well the Kepler observations, including the characteristic depression in the linewidths around the frequency of maximum oscillation power. Furthermore, we thoroughly test the sensitivity of the calculated damping rates to changes in the parameters of the nonlocal convection model.},

  abstract = {Previously [Y/Mg] has been proven to be an age indicator for solar twins. Here, we investigate if this relation also holds for helium-core-burning stars of solar metallicity. High resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectroscopic data of stars in the helium-core-burning phase have been obtained with the FIES spectrograph on the NOT 2.56m telescope and the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck I 10 m telescope. They have been analyzed to determine the chemical abundances of four open clusters with close to solar metallicity; NGC 6811, NGC 6819, M67 and NGC 188. The abundances are derived from equivalent widths of spectral lines using ATLAS9 model atmospheres with parameters determined from the excitation and ionization balance of Fe lines. Results from asteroseismology and binary studies were used as priors on the atmospheric parameters, where especially the \$\textbackslash{}log g\$ is determined to much higher precision than what is possible with spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the four open clusters are close to solar metallicity and they follow the [Y/Mg] vs. age trend previously found for solar twins. The [Y/Mg] vs. age clock also works for giant stars in the helium-core burning phase, which vastly increases the possibilities to estimate the age of stars not only in the solar neighborhood, but in large parts of the Galaxy, due to the brighter nature of evolved stars compared to dwarfs.},

  shorttitle = {{{NGC}} 6819},
  abstract = {We present an extensive peakbagging effort on Kepler data of \$\textbackslash{}sim\$50 red giant stars in the open star cluster NGC 6819. By employing sophisticated pre-processing of the time series and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques we extracted individual frequencies, heights and linewidths for hundreds of oscillation modes. We show that the "average" asteroseismic parameter \$\textbackslash{}delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\{02\}\$, derived from these, can be used to distinguish the stellar evolutionary state between the red giant branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars. Masses and radii are estimated using asteroseismic scaling relations, both empirically corrected to obtain self-consistency as well as agreement with independent measures of distance, and using updated theoretical corrections. Remarkable agreement is found, allowing the evolutionary state of the giants to be determined exclusively from the empirical correction to the scaling relations. We find a mean mass of the RGB stars and RC stars in NGC 6819 to be \$1.61\textbackslash{}pm0.02\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$ and \$1.64\{\textbackslash{}pm\}0.02\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$, respectively. The difference \$\textbackslash{}Delta M=-0.03\textbackslash{}pm0.01\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$ is almost insensitive to systematics, suggesting very little RGB mass loss, if any. Stars that are outliers relative to the ensemble reveal overmassive members that likely evolved via mass-transfer in a blue straggler phase. We suggest that KIC 4937011, a low-mass Li-rich giant, is a cluster member in the RC phase that experienced very high mass-loss during its evolution. Such over- and undermassive stars need to be considered when studying field giants, since the true age of such stars cannot be known and there is currently no way to distinguish them from normal stars.},

  abstract = {As part of our study of the old (\textasciitilde{}2.5 Gyr) open cluster NGC 6819 in the Kepler field, we present photometric (Kepler and ground-based BVRcIc) and spectroscopic observations of the detached eclipsing binary WOCS 24009 (Auner 665; KIC 5023948) with a short orbital period of 3.6 days. WOCS 24009 is a triple-lined system, and we verify that the brightest star is physically orbiting the eclipsing binary using radial velocities and eclipse timing variations. The eclipsing binary components have masses M\_B =1.090+/-0.010 Msun and M\_C =1.075+/-0.013 Msun, and radii R\_B =1.095+/-0.007 Rsun and R\_C =1.057+/-0.008 Rsun. The bright non-eclipsing star resides at the cluster turnoff, and ultimately its mass will directly constrain the turnoff mass: our preliminary determination is M\_A =1.251+/-0.057 Msun. A careful examination of the light curves indicates that the fainter star in the eclipsing binary undergoes a very brief period of total eclipse, which enables us to precisely decompose the light of the three stars and place them in the color-magnitude diagram. We also present improved analysis of two previously discussed detached eclipsing stars in NGC 6819 (WOCS 40007 and WOCS 23009) en route to a combined determination of the cluster's distance modulus (m-M)\_V=12.38+/-0.04. Because this paper significantly increases the number of measured stars in the cluster, we can better constrain the age of the color-magnitude diagram to be 2.21+/-0.10+/-0.20 Gyr. Additionally, using all measured eclipsing binary star masses and radii, we constrain the age to 2.38+/-0.05+/-0.22 Gyr. The quoted uncertainties are estimates of measurement and systematic uncertainties (due to model physics differences and metal content), respectively.},

  abstract = {Surface and spatial radial density profiles in open clusters are derived using a kernel estimator method. Formulae are obtained for the contribution of every star into the spatial density profile. The evaluation of spatial density profiles is tested against open-cluster models from N-body experiments with N = 500. Surface density profiles are derived for seven open clusters (NGC 1502, 1960, 2287, 2516, 2682, 6819 and 6939) using Two-Micron All-Sky Survey data and for different limiting magnitudes. The selection of an optimal kernel half-width is discussed. It is shown that open-cluster radius estimates hardly depend on the kernel half-width. Hints of stellar mass segregation and structural features indicating cluster non-stationarity in the regular force field are found. A comparison with other investigations shows that the data on open-cluster sizes are often underestimated. The existence of an extended corona around the open cluster NGC 6939 was confirmed. A combined function composed of the King density profile for the cluster core and the uniform sphere for the cluster corona is shown to be a better approximation of the surface radial density profile.The King function alone does not reproduce surface density profiles of sample clusters properly. The number of stars, the cluster masses and the tidal radii in the Galactic gravitational field for the sample clusters are estimated. It is shown that NGC 6819 and 6939 are extended beyond their tidal surfaces.},

For the MS stars we find [Fe/H] = \$+\$0.05 \$\textbackslash{}pm\$ 0.04 and [Ba/Fe] = \$-\$0.01 \$\textbackslash{}pm\$ 0.10. The majority of the BS stars are consistent with these values. We identify five BSs with significant barium enhancement. These stars most likely formed through mass transfer from an asymptotic giant branch star that polluted the surface of the BS with the nucleosynthesis products generated during thermal pulsations. This conclusion aligns with the results from the substantial work done on the BSs in old open cluster NGC 188 that identifies mass transfer as the dominant mechanism for BS formation in that open cluster. However, four of the BSs with enhanced barium show no radial-velocity evidence for a companion. The one star that is in a binary is a double-lined system, meaning the companion is not a white dwarf and not the remnant of a prior AGB star. In this paper we attempt to develop a consistent scenario to explain the origin of these five BSs.},

  abstract = {Determining the level of chemical homogeneity in open clusters is of fundamental importance in the study of the evolution of star-forming clouds and that of the Galactic disk. Yet limiting the initial abundance spread in clusters has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining consistent spectroscopic abundances for different stellar types. Without reference to any specific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a homogeneous cluster is that it forms a one-dimensional sequence, with any differences between members due to variations in stellar mass and observational uncertainties. I present a novel method for investigating the abundance spread in open clusters that tests this one-dimensional hypothesis at the level of observed stellar spectra, rather than constraining homogeneity using derived abundances as traditionally done. Using high-resolution APOGEE spectra for 49 giants in M67, NGC 6819, and NGC 2420 I demonstrate that these spectra form one-dimensional sequences for each cluster. With detailed forward modeling of the spectra and Approximate Bayesian Computation, I derive strong limits on the initial abundance spread of 15 elements: {$<$}0.01 (0.02) dex for C and Fe, {$<\sptilde$}0.015 (0.03) dex for N, O, Mg, Si, and Ni, {$<\sptilde$}0.02 (0.03) dex for Al, Ca, and Mn, and {$<\sptilde$}0.03 (0.05) dex for Na, S, K, Ti, and V (at 68\% and 95\% confidence, respectively). The strong limits on C and O imply that no pollution by massive core-collapse supernovae occurred during star formation in open clusters, which, thus, need to form within {$<\sptilde$}6 Myr. Further development of this and related techniques will bring the power of differential abundances to stars other than solar twins in large spectroscopic surveys and will help unravel the history of star formation and chemical enrichment in the Milky Way through chemical tagging.},

  abstract = {A Li-rich red giant star (2M19411367+4003382) recently discovered in the direction of NGC 6819 belongs to the rare subset of Li-rich stars that have not yet evolved to the luminosity bump, an evolutionary stage where models predict Li can be replenished. The currently favored model to explain Li enhancement in first-ascent red giants like 2M19411367+4003382 requires deep mixing into the stellar interior. Testing this model requires a measurement of 12C/13C, which is possible to obtain from APOGEE spectra. However, the Li-rich star also has abnormal asteroseismic properties that call into question its membership in the cluster, even though its radial velocity and location on color-magnitude diagrams are consistent with membership. To address these puzzles, we have measured a wide array of abundances in the Li-rich star and three comparison stars using spectra taken as part of the APOGEE survey to determine the degree of stellar mixing, address the question of membership, and measure the surface gravity. We confirm that the Li-rich star is a red giant with the same overall chemistry as the other cluster giants. However, its log g is significantly lower, consistent with the asteroseismology results and suggestive of a very low mass if the star is indeed a cluster member. Regardless of the cluster membership, the 12C/13C and C/N ratios of the Li-rich star are consistent with standard first dredge-up, indicating that Li dilution has already occurred, and inconsistent with internal Li enrichment scenarios that require deep mixing.},

Our spectra, with signal-to-noise per pixel (SNR) ranging from 60 to 300, span the luminosity range from the tip of the red giant branch to a point two magnitudes below the top of the cluster turnoff. We derive radial and rotational velocities for all stars, as well as [Fe/H] based on 17 iron lines, [Ca/H], [Si/H], and [Ni/H] in the 247 most probable, single members of the cluster. Input temperature estimates for model atmosphere analysis are provided by (B-V) colors merged from several sources, with individual reddening corrections applied to each star relative to a cluster mean of E(B-V) = 0.16. Extensive use is made of ROBOSPECT, an automatic equivalent width measurement program; its effectiveness on large spectroscopic samples is discussed. From the sample of likely single members, [Fe/H] = -0.03 +/- 0.06, where the error describes the median absolute deviation about the sample median value, leading to an internal precision for the cluster below 0.01 dex. The final uncertainty in the cluster abundance is therefore dominated by external systematics due to the temperature scale, surface gravity, and microturbulent velocity, leading to [Fe/H] = -0.02 +/- 0.02 for a sub-sample restricted to main sequence and turnoff stars. This result is consistent with our recent intermediate-band photometric determination of a slightly subsolar abundance for this cluster. [Ca/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ni/Fe] are determined to be solar within the uncertainties. NGC 6819 has an abundance distribution typical of solar metallicity thin disk stars in the solar neighborhood.},

We extracted the frequencies of the radial and quadrupole modes from its frequency power spectrum and determined its properties using a grid of evolutionary models constructed with MESA. The oscillation frequencies were calculated using the GYRE code and the surface term was corrected using the Ball \& Gizon(2014) prescription. We find that the star has a mass of \$M/M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\} = 1.793\textbackslash{}pm 0.072\$, age \$t=1.48\textbackslash{}pm 0.21\$ Gyr and radius \$R/R\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\} = 10.53\textbackslash{}pm 0.28\$. By analyzing the internal structure of the best-fitting model, we infer the evolutionary status of the star KIC 8263801 as being on the ascending part of the red giant branch, and not on the red clump. This result is verified using a purely asteroseismic diagnostic, the \$\textbackslash{}epsilon\_\{c\}-\textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\{c\}\$ diagram which can distinguish red giant branch stars from red clump stars. Finally, by comparing its age with NGC 6866 (\$t=0.65 \textbackslash{}pm 0.1\$ Gyr) we conclude that KIC 8263801 is not a member of this open cluster.},

These pulsations arise due to the various ongoing physical phenomena of the variables. Moreover, pulsations of the variables are identified through the visual inspection of their frequency-amplitude distributions. A total of 18 variables among the 28 known variables are showing the secondary pulsation modes. Furthermore, these pulsation modes do not occur for PV, EA, EB, Elliptical and semi-regular. In addition, the field variables seem to be the red-component-stars (RCS) for the studied cluster. The smoothness of the frequency-amplitude curves, signal to noise ratio and the significant limits are play major role for deciding the real peak or frequency values. We are not rejected those amplitude peak of parabolic patterns, for which, the amplitude is greater than then significant limit of variables. The weight of pulsation frequencies is given to be 0.5 for non full cyclic variation but the amplitude is greater than significant limit. Similarly, our present analysis does not support the HADS characteristics of previous known HADS stars within stellar cluster NGC 6866. We are also proposed to new correlation between the secondary pulsation modes (depending frequencies) and the absolute magnitude of known variables.},

  abstract = {We present CCD \$UBVRI\$ photometry of the field of the open cluster NGC 6866. Structural parameters of the cluster are determined utilizing the stellar density profile of the stars in the field. We calculate the probabilities of the stars being a physical member of the cluster using their astrometric data and perform further analyses using only the most probable members. The reddening and metallicity of the cluster were determined by independent methods. The LAMOST spectra and the ultraviolet excess of the F and G type main-sequence stars in the cluster indicate that the metallicity of the cluster is about the solar value. We estimated the reddening \$E(B-V)=0.074 \textbackslash{}pm 0.050\$ mag using the \$U-B\$ vs \$B-V\$ two-colour diagram. The distance modula, the distance and the age of NGC 6866 were derived as \$\textbackslash{}mu = 10.60 \textbackslash{}pm 0.10\$ mag, \$d=1189 \textbackslash{}pm 75\$ pc and \$t = 813 \textbackslash{}pm 50\$ Myr, respectively, by fitting colour-magnitude diagrams of the cluster with the PARSEC isochrones. The Galactic orbit of NGC 6866 indicates that the cluster is orbiting in a slightly eccentric orbit with \$e=0.12\$. The mass function slope \$x=1.35 \textbackslash{}pm 0.08\$ was derived by using the most probable members of the cluster.},

For clusters in the age range of NGC 6866, with few if any red giant members, a purely photometric determination of the cluster properties is not well-constrained. Nevertheless, based on our UBVRI photometry alone, we have derived the distance, reddening, age and metallicity of the cluster and established estimates for the binary nature and membership probability of individual stars.

The position on the color-magnitude diagram of seven other variables suggests that they also belong to the cluster. The eclipsing binary, which we discover to be a new high-velocity star, and the seven irregular variables are non-members.

The primary is a metal-lined Am star with a possible convective blueshift to its radial velocities, and one star (probably the secondary) is likely to be a \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ Dor pulsator. The component masses are \$1.603\textbackslash{}pm0.006\$(stat.)\$\textbackslash{}pm0.016\$(sys.) and \$1.419\textbackslash{}pm0.003\textbackslash{}pm0.008 M\_\textbackslash{}odot\$, and the radii are \$1.744\textbackslash{}pm0.004\textbackslash{}pm0.002\$ and \$1.544\textbackslash{}pm0.002\textbackslash{}pm0.002 R\_\textbackslash{}odot\$. The isochrone ages of the stars are mildly inconsistent: the age from the mass-radius combination for the primary (\$1.05\textbackslash{}pm0.05\textbackslash{}pm0.09\$ Gyr, where the last quote was systematic uncertainty from models and metallicity) is smaller than that from the secondary (\$1.21\textbackslash{}pm0.05\textbackslash{}pm0.15\$ Gyr) and is consistent with the inference from the color-magnitude diagram (\$1.00\textbackslash{}pm0.05\$ Gyr). We have improved the measurements of the asteroseismic parameters \$\textbackslash{}Delta \textbackslash{}nu\$ and \$\textbackslash{}nu\_\{\textbackslash{}rm max\}\$ for helium-burning stars in the cluster. The masses of the stars appear to be larger (or alternately, the radii appear to be smaller) than predicted from isochrones using the ages derived from the eclipsing stars. The majority of stars near the cluster turnoff are pulsating stars: we identify a sample of 28 \$\textbackslash{}delta\$ Sct, 15 \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ Dor, and 5 hybrid types. We used the period-luminosity relation for high-amplitude \$\textbackslash{}delta\$ Sct stars to fit the ensemble of the strongest frequencies for the cluster members, finding \$(m-M)\_V = 10.37\textbackslash{}pm0.03\$.

Cluster member stars were separated from the field stars using the Galaxia model of Sharma et al. (2011) together with other techniques. The core radius of the cluster is found to be \$r\_\{c\}\$=3.60 arcmin. The astrophysical parameters were determined simultaneously via Bayesian statistics using the colour-magnitude diagrams V versus B-V, V versus V-I, V versus V-R, and V versus R-I of the cluster. The resulting most likely parameters were further confirmed using independent methods, removing any possible degeneracies.

  abstract = {The NASA space telescope Kepler has provided unprecedented time-series observations which have revolutionised the field of asteroseismology, i.e. the use of stellar oscillations to probe the interior of stars. The Kepler-data include observations of stars in open clusters, which are particularly interesting for asteroseismology. One of the clusters observed with Kepler is NGC 6811, which is the target of the present paper. However, apart from high-precision time-series observations, sounding the interiors of stars in open clusters by means of asteroseismology also requires accurate and precise atmospheric parameters as well as cluster membership indicators for the individual stars. We use medium-resolution (R\textasciitilde{}25,000) spectroscopic observations, and three independent analysis methods, to derive effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, projected rotational velocities and radial velocities, for 15 stars in the field of the open cluster NGC 6811. We discover two double-lined and three single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Eight stars are classified as either certain or very probable cluster members, and three stars are classified as non-members. For four stars, cluster membership could not been assessed. Five of the observed stars are G-type giants which are located in the colour-magnitude diagram in the region of the red clump of the cluster. Two of these stars are surely identified as red clump stars for the first time. For those five stars, we provide chemical abundances of 31 elements. The mean radial-velocity of NGC 6811 is found to be +6.68\$\textbackslash{}pm\$0.08 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ and the mean metallicity and overall abundance pattern are shown to be very close to solar with an exception of Ba which we find to be overabundant.},

  abstract = {The study of open clusters and their short period variable stars is fundamental in stellar evolution. Because the cluster members are formed in almost the same physical conditions, they share similar stellar properties such age and chemical composition. The assumption of common age, metallicity and distance impose strong constraints when modeling an ensemble of short period pulsators belonging to open clusters (e.g. Fox Machado et al., 2006). Very recently, Luo et al. (2009) carried out a search for variable stars in the direction of NGC 6811 with CCD photometry in B and V bands. They detected a total of sixteen variable stars. Among these variables, twelve were catalogued as \$\textbackslash{}delta\$ \{\textbackslash{}it Scuti\} stars, while no variability type was assigned to the remaining stars.

Ensemble \textbackslash{}'\{e\}chelle diagrams and upper limits to the linewidths of l = 0 modes as a function of \textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu of the clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 6819 are also shown, together with the correlation between the l = 0 ridge width and the T\_eff of the stars. Lastly, we distinguish between red giant branch and red clump stars through the measurement of the period spacing of mixed dipole modes in 53 stars among all the three clusters to verify the stellar classification from the color-magnitude diagram. These seismic results also allow us to identify a number of special cases, including evolved blue stragglers and binaries, as well as stars in late He-core burning phases, which can be potentially interesting targets for detailed theoretical modeling.},

The large numbers of red giants with observed oscillations make it possible to investigate the properties of the sample as a whole: ensemble asteroseismology. In this article we summarise ensemble asteroseismology results obtained from data released by the Kepler Science Team (\textasciitilde{}150,000 field stars) as presented by Hekker et al. (2011b) and for the clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6811 and NGC 6819 (Hekker et al. 2011a) and we discuss the importance of such studies.},

  abstract = {Context: Four open clusters are present in the Kepler field of view and timeseries of nearly a year in length are now available. These timeseries allow us to derive asteroseismic global oscillation parameters of red-giant stars in the three open clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6819 and NGC 6811. From these parameters and effective temperatures, we derive mass, radii and luminosities for the clusters as well as field red giants. Aims: We study the influence of evolution and metallicity on the observed red-giant populations. Methods: The global oscillation parameters are derived using different published methods and the effective temperatures are derived from 2MASS colours. The observational results are compared with BaSTI evolution models. Results: We find that the mass has significant influence on the asteroseismic quantities delta\_nu vs. nu\_max relation, while the influence of metallicity is negligible, under the assumption that the metallicity does not affect the excitation / damping of the oscillations. The positions of the stars in the H-R diagram depend on both mass and metallicity. Furthermore, the stellar masses derived for the field stars are bracketed by those of the cluster stars. Conclusions: Both the mass and metallicity contribute to the observed difference in locations in the H-R diagram of the old metal-rich cluster NGC 6791 and the middle-aged solar-metallicity cluster NGC 6819. For the young cluster NGC 6811, the explanation of the position of the stars in the H-R diagram challenges the assumption of solar metallicity, and this open cluster might have significantly lower metallicity [Fe/H] in the range -0.3 to -0.7 dex. Also, nearly all the observed field stars seem to be older than NGC 6811 and younger than NGC 6791.},

Within the first century following Fabricius, four Mira-type variables were discovered, and in all cases it has been found that the stars were suspected of being novae long before their "official" discovery in the Western World. Three of the four had been recorded as novae in early Chinese or Korean records. By 1896, 251 Mira-type variabes had been discovered, most of them after the beginning of photographic experimentation. Now in the year of the fourth centennial, over 6000 Miras are known. Because of their ease of discovery relative to stars of small amplitude, no new Mira stars reaching naked-eye visibility have been discovered since 1899. The history of the discovery of Mira-type variables illustrates that (1) some new discoveries are re-discoveries of objects previously assumed to be novae; and (2) apparently logical deductions that early observations of a guest star correspond to a later discovered Mire-type may nevertheless be wrong.},

We comment briefly on delta Scuti stars and pulsating white dwarfs. For some of these variable star types, observations agree approximately with the predictions of evolutionary models, but there still exist significant areas of disagreement that challenge future models of stellar evolution. There may be a need, for instance, to include processes such as rotation, mass loss, and magnetic fields. There may also be non-evolutionary processes which are contributing to the period changes.},

segregate likely cluster members of four low Galactic latitude open

high-precision astrometric data of the Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia-DR2).
The GMM method is used to calculate the membership probabilities of the

quantitatively evaluate the goodness of the cluster-field segregation
for each cluster, and find that the GMM method is effective for
segregating likely cluster members of these clusters, even if these
clusters suffer from heavy field star contamination. We estimate the
distances and absolute proper motions of these clusters using reliable
cluster members; our results suggest the existence of a significant

handling high-dimensional data sets. We use this method to investigate
the likely memberships of the old open cluster NGC 188 based on the

  abstract = {Context: Open clusters are ideal laboratories to investigate a variety 
of astrophysical topics, from the properties of the Galactic disk to
stellar evolutionary models. Knowing their metallicity and possibly
detailed chemical abundances is therefore important. However, the number
of systems with chemical abundances determined from high resolution
spectroscopy is still small.\textbackslash\textbackslash{} Aims: To increase the number of open
clusters with radial velocities and chemical abundances determined from
high resolution spectroscopy we used publicly available catalogues of
surveys in combination with Gaia data.\textbackslash\textbackslash{} Methods: Open cluster stars
have been identified in the APOGEE and GALAH spectroscopic surveys by
cross-matching their latest data releases with stars for which
high-probability astrometric membership has been derived in many
clusters on the basis of the Gaia second data release.\textbackslash\textbackslash{} Results: Radial
velocities have been determined for 131 and 14 clusters from APOGEE and
GALAH data, respectively. This is the first radial velocity
determination from high resolution spectra for 16 systems. Iron
abundances have been obtained for 90 and 14 systems from APOGEE and
GALAH samples, respectively. To our knowledge 66 of these clusters (57
in APOGEE and 9 in GALAH) do not have previous determinations in the
literature. For 90 and 7 clusters in the APOGEE and GALAH samples,
respectively, we have also determined average abundances for Na, Mg, Al,
Si, Ca, Cr, Mn, and Ni.},

populations as globular clusters, more observations can be taken to
measure dynamical properties. With the advent of the high-volume,
high-precision astrometric data from the Gaia satellite and the Gaia DR2
release, we can study the dynamical state of open clusters to an
unprecedented degree. We primarily look at quantifying any signatures of
bulk cluster rotation that may be still present within open clusters
that was imparted from the collapse of their nascent molecular cloud. We
form a 6-dimensional picture of the dynamical state of these open
clusters using the available data. We analyze the bulk cluster of
several open clusters, and discuss the implications as it relates to the
resulting evolution of binary stars, as well as exotic stellar phenomena
such as blue straggler stars.},

  abstract = {GALAH is a large-scale magnitude-limited southern stellar spectroscopic 
survey. Its second data release (GALAH DR2) provides values of stellar
parameters and abundances of 23 elements for 342 682 stars (Buder et
al.). Here we add a description of the public release of radial
velocities with a typical accuracy of 0.1 km s-1 for 336 215
of these stars, achievable due to the large wavelength coverage, high
resolving power, and good signal-to-noise ratio of the observed spectra,
but also because convective motions in stellar atmosphere and
gravitational redshift from the star to the observer are taken into
account. In the process we derive medians of observed spectra that are
nearly noiseless, as they are obtained from between 100 and 1116
observed spectra belonging to the same bin with a width of 50 K in
temperature, 0.2 dex in gravity, and 0.1 dex in metallicity. Publicly
released 1181 median spectra have a resolving power of 28 000 and trace
the well-populated stellar types with metallicities between -0.6 and
+0.3. Note that radial velocities from GALAH are an excellent match to
the accuracy of velocity components along the sky plane derived by Gaia
for the same stars. The level of accuracy achieved here is adequate for
studies of dynamics within stellar clusters, associations, and streams
in the Galaxy. So it may be relevant for studies of the distribution of
dark matter.},

  abstract = {Converting a noisy parallax measurement into a posterior belief over distance requires inference with a prior. Usually, this prior represents beliefs about the stellar density distribution of the Milky Way. However, multiband photometry exists for a large fraction of the Gaia-TGAS Catalog and is incredibly informative about stellar distances. Here, we use 2MASS colors for 1.4 million TGAS stars to build a
noise-deconvolved empirical prior distribution for stars in
color\textendash{}magnitude space. This model contains no knowledge of stellar astrophysics or the Milky Way but is precise because it accurately generates a large number of noisy parallax measurements under an assumption of stationarity; that is, it is capable of combining the information from many stars. We use the Extreme Deconvolution (XD) algorithm\textemdash{}which is an empirical-Bayes approximation to a
full-hierarchical model of the true parallax and photometry of every star\textemdash{}to construct this prior. The prior is combined with a TGAS
likelihood to infer a precise photometric-parallax estimate and
uncertainty (and full posterior) for every star. Our parallax estimates are more precise than the TGAS catalog entries by a median factor of 1.2 (14\% are more precise by a factor {$>$}2) and they are more precise than the previous Bayesian distance estimates that use spatial priors. We validate our parallax inferences using members of the Milky Way star cluster M67, which is not visible as a cluster in the TGAS parallax estimates but appears as a cluster in our posterior parallax estimates. Our results, including a parallax posterior probability distribution function for each of 1.4 million TGAS stars, are available in companion electronic tables.},

data-mining techniques and machine-learning algorithms is mandatory. Aims: A great example of the application of such techniques and
algorithms is the search for open clusters (OCs), groups of stars that
were born and move together, located in the disc. Our aim is to develop
a method to automatically explore the data space, requiring minimal
manual intervention. Methods: We explore the performance of a
density-based clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, to find clusters in the data
together with a supervised learning method such as an artificial neural
network (ANN) to automatically distinguish between real OCs and
statistical clusters. Results: The development and implementation
of this method in a five-dimensional space (l, b, {$\varpi$},
{$\mu\alpha$}*, {$\mu\delta$}) with the
Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) data, and a posterior validation
using Gaia DR2 data, lead to the proposal of a set of new nearby OCs.
 Conclusions: We have developed a method to find OCs in

  abstract = {We analyzed high-precision Kepler photometry and high-resolution UVES 
and GIRAFFE spectroscopy from ESO Science Archieve for a double-lined
eclipsing binary star in the field of the high metallicity old open
cluster NGC 6791. Earlier measurements of the masses and radii of the
detached system were not accurate enough for photometric and
spectroscopic data to demonstrate that there are significant differences
between current stellar models. Here we improved on the result and add
follow-up measurements of the system. Data from the Kepler archive makes
it clear that the system has an inclination that is close to 90\textdegree.
The combination of radial velocity and Kepler light curve of the system
were analysed simultaneously, which allows us to determine a reliable
mass for the primary and secondary star and radii for both stars, and to
constrain the cluster age. The characteristics of the primary star at
the cluster turnoff indicate an age of 8.5 {$\pm$} 0.12 Gyr, consistent
with earlier analysis of the color-magnitude diagram. The brighter star
in the binary also produces a precision estimate of the distance
modulus, independent of reddening estimates: (m-M)V
(mag)=13.899 {$\pm$} 0.117. The secondary star is not expected to have
evolved significantly, but its radius is more than 10\% larger than
predicted by models. The hallmark is useful for testing the idea that
radius inflation can occur in short period binaries for stars with
significant convective envelopes due to the inhibition of energy
transport by magnetic fields.},

  volume = {618},
  issn = {0004-6361},
  abstract = {Context. Oscillation modes with a mixed character, as observed in 
evolved low-mass stars, are highly sensitive to the physical properties
of the innermost regions. Measuring their properties is therefore
extremely important to probe the core, but requires some care, due to
the complexity of the mixed-mode pattern. Aims: The aim of this
work is to provide a consistent description of the mixed-mode pattern of
low-mass stars, based on the asymptotic expansion. We also study the
variation of the gravity offset {$\varepsilon$}g with stellar
evolution. Methods: We revisit previous works about mixed modes
in red giants and empirically test how period spacings, rotational
splittings, mixed-mode widths, and heights can be estimated in a
consistent view, based on the properties of the mode inertia ratios. Results: From the asymptotic fit of the mixed-mode pattern of a large
set of red giants at various evolutionary stages, we derive unbiased and
precise asymptotic parameters. As the asymptotic expansion of gravity
modes is verified with a precision close to the frequency resolution for
stars on the red giant branch (10-4 in relative values), we
can derive accurate values of the asymptotic parameters. We decipher the
complex pattern in a rapidly rotating star, and explain how asymmetrical
splittings can be inferred. We also revisit the stellar inclinations in
two open clusters, NGC 6819 and NGC 6791: our results show that the
stellar inclinations in these clusters do not have privileged
orientation in the sky. The variation of the asymptotic gravity offset
with stellar evolution is investigated in detail. We also derive generic
properties that explain under which conditions mixed modes can be
observed.

  shorttitle = {{{NGC}} 6791},
  abstract = {NGC 6791 is a unique stellar cluster, key to our understanding of both the multiple stellar population phenomenon and the evolution and assembly of the Galaxy. However, despite many investigations, its nature is still very controversial. Geisler et al. (2012) found evidence suggesting it was the first open cluster to possess multiple populations but several subsequent studies did not corroborate this. It has also been considered a member of the thin or thick disk or even the bulge, and both as an open or globular cluster or even the remnant of a dwarf galaxy. Here, we present and discuss detailed abundances derived from high resolution spectra obtained with UVES at VLT and HIRES at Keck of 17 evolved stars of this cluster. We obtained a mean [Fe/H]=+0.313+-0.005, in good agreement with recent estimates, and with no indication of star-to-star metallicity variation, as expected. We also did not find any variation in Na, in spite of having selected the very same stars as in Geisler et al. (2012), where a Na variation was claimed. This points to the presence of probable systematics in the lower resolution spectra of this very high metallicity cluster analysed in that work. In fact, we find no evidence for an intrinsic spread in any element, corroborating recent independent APOGEE data. The derived abundances indicate that NGC 6791 very likely formed in the Galactic Bulge and that the proposed association with the Thick Disk is unlikely, despite its present Galactic location. We confirm the most recent hypothesis suggesting that the cluster could have formed in the Bulge and radially migrated to its current location, which appears the best explanation for this intriguing object.},

The calculations adopt a time-dependent non-local convection model, with the turbulent pressure profile being calibrated to results of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar atmospheres. The linewidths are obtained from extensive peakbagging of Kepler lightcurves. These observational results are of unprecedented quality owing to the long continuous observations by Kepler. The uniqueness of the Kepler mission also means that, for asteroseismic properties, this is the best data that will be available for a long time to come. We therefore take great care in modelling nine RGB stars in NGC 6819 using information from 3D simulations to obtain realistic temperature stratifications and calibrated turbulent pressure profiles. Our modelled damping rates reproduce well the Kepler observations, including the characteristic depression in the linewidths around the frequency of maximum oscillation power. Furthermore, we thoroughly test the sensitivity of the calculated damping rates to changes in the parameters of the nonlocal convection model.},

By employing sophisticated pre-processing of the time series and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques we extracted individual frequencies, heights and linewidths for hundreds of oscillation modes. We show that the "average" asteroseismic parameter \$\textbackslash{}delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\{02\}\$, derived from these, can be used to distinguish the stellar evolutionary state between the red giant branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars. Masses and radii are estimated using asteroseismic scaling relations, both empirically corrected to obtain self-consistency as well as agreement with independent measures of distance, and using updated theoretical corrections. Remarkable agreement is found, allowing the evolutionary state of the giants to be determined exclusively from the empirical correction to the scaling relations. We find a mean mass of the RGB stars and RC stars in NGC 6819 to be \$1.61\textbackslash{}pm0.02\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$ and \$1.64\{\textbackslash{}pm\}0.02\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$, respectively. The difference \$\textbackslash{}Delta M=-0.03\textbackslash{}pm0.01\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$ is almost insensitive to systematics, suggesting very little RGB mass loss, if any. Stars that are outliers relative to the ensemble reveal overmassive members that likely evolved via mass-transfer in a blue straggler phase. We suggest that KIC 4937011, a low-mass Li-rich giant, is a cluster member in the RC phase that experienced very high mass-loss during its evolution. Such over- and undermassive stars need to be considered when studying field giants, since the true age of such stars cannot be known and there is currently no way to distinguish them from normal stars.},

  abstract = {Advances in astronomy are often driven by serendipitous discoveries. As survey astronomy continues to grow, the size and complexity of astronomical databases will increase, and the ability of astronomers to manually scour data and make such discoveries decreases. In this work, we introduce a machine learning-based method to identify anomalies in large datasets to facilitate such discoveries, and apply this method to long cadence lightcurves from NASA's Kepler Mission. Our method clusters data based on density, identifying anomalies as data that lie outside of dense regions. This work serves as a proof-of-concept case study and we test our method on four quarters of the Kepler long cadence lightcurves. We use Kepler's most notorious anomaly, Boyajian's Star (KIC 8462852), as a rare `ground truth' for testing outlier identification to verify that objects of genuine scientific interest are included among the identified anomalies. We evaluate the method's ability to identify known anomalies by identifying unusual behavior in Boyajian's Star, we report the full list of identified anomalies for these quarters, and present a sample subset of identified outliers that includes unusual phenomena, objects that are rare in the Kepler field, and data artifacts. By identifying {$<$}4\% of each quarter as outlying data, we demonstrate that this anomaly detection method can create a more targeted approach in searching for rare and novel phenomena.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses an algorithm for detecting single transits in photometric time-series data. Specifically, we aim to identify asymmetric transits with ingress that is more rapid than egress, as expected for cometary bodies with a significant tail. The algorithm is automated, so can be applied to large samples and only a relatively small number of events need to be manually vetted. We applied this algorithm to all long cadence light curves from the Kepler mission, finding 16 candidate transits with significant asymmetry, 11 of which were found to be artefacts or symmetric transits after manual inspection. Of the 5 remaining events, four are the 0.1\% depth events previously identified for KIC 3542116 and 11084727. We identify HD 182952 (KIC 8027456) as a third system showing a potential comet transit. All three stars showing these events have H-R diagram locations consistent with \$\textbackslash{}sim\$100Myr-old open cluster stars, as might be expected given that cometary source regions deplete with age, and giving credence to the comet hypothesis. If these events are part of the same population of events as seen for KIC 8462852, the small increase in detections at 0.1\% depth compared to 10\% depth suggests that future work should consider whether the distribution is naturally flat, or if comets with symmetric transits in this depth range remain undiscovered. Future searches relying on asymmetry should be more successful if they focus on larger samples and young stars, rather than digging further into the noise.},

  abstract = {The presence and strength of a stellar magnetic field and activity is rooted in a star's fundamental parameters such as mass and age. Can flares serve as an accurate stellar "clock"? To explore if we can quantify an activity-age relation in the form of a flaring-age relation, we measured trends in the flaring rates and energies for stars with different masses and ages. We investigated the time-domain photometry provided by Kepler's follow-up mission K2 and searched for flares in three solar metallicity open clusters with well-known ages, M45 (0.125 Gyr), M44 (0.63 Gyr), and M67 (4.3 Gyr). We updated and employed the automated flare finding and analysis pipeline Appaloosa, originally designed for Kepler. We introduced a synthetic flare injection and recovery subroutine to ascribe detection and energy recovery rates for flares in a broad energy range for each light curve. We collected a sample of 1 761 stars, mostly late-K to mid-M dwarfs and found 751 flare candidates with energies ranging from \$4\textbackslash{}cdot10\^\{32\}\$ erg to \$6\textbackslash{}cdot10\^\{34\}\$ erg, of which 596 belong to M45, 155 to M44, and none to M67. We find that flaring activity depends both on \$T\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{eff\}\$, and age. But all flare frequency distributions have similar slopes with \$\textbackslash{}alpha \textbackslash{}approx2.0-2.4\$, supporting a universal flare generation process. We discuss implications for the physical conditions under which flares occur, and how the sample's metallicity and multiplicity affect our results.},

We identify this secondary star as a bloated (proto) extremely low-mass helium white dwarf. These properties of V106 suggest that it represents a typical Algol-paradox system and that it evolved through a mass-transfer phase which provides insight into its past evolution. We present a detailed binary stellar evolution model for the formation of V106 using the MESA code and find that the mass-transfer phase only ceased about 40 Myr ago. Due to the short orbital period (P=1.4463 d) another mass-transfer phase is unavoidable once the current primary star evolves towards the red giant phase. We argue that V106 will evolve through a common-envelope phase within the next 100 Myr and merge to become a single over-massive giant. The high mass will make it appear young for its true age, which is revealed by the cluster properties. Therefore, V106 is potentially a prototype progenitor of old field giants masquerading as young.},

  abstract = {We present an asteroseismic analysis of the Kepler light curve of KIC 8263801, a red-giant star in the open cluster NGC 6866 that has previously been reported to be a helium-burning red-clump star. We extracted the frequencies of the radial and quadrupole modes from its frequency power spectrum and determined its properties using a grid of evolutionary models constructed with MESA. The oscillation frequencies were calculated using the GYRE code and the surface term was corrected using the Ball \& Gizon(2014) prescription. We find that the star has a mass of \$M/M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\} = 1.793\textbackslash{}pm 0.072\$, age \$t=1.48\textbackslash{}pm 0.21\$ Gyr and radius \$R/R\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\} = 10.53\textbackslash{}pm 0.28\$. By analyzing the internal structure of the best-fitting model, we infer the evolutionary status of the star KIC 8263801 as being on the ascending part of the red giant branch, and not on the red clump. This result is verified using a purely asteroseismic diagnostic, the \$\textbackslash{}epsilon\_\{c\}-\textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\{c\}\$ diagram which can distinguish red giant branch stars from red clump stars. Finally, by comparing its age with NGC 6866 (\$t=0.65 \textbackslash{}pm 0.1\$ Gyr) we conclude that KIC 8263801 is not a member of this open cluster.},

  abstract = {Kepler seeks to detect sequences of transits of Earth-size exoplanets orbiting solar-like stars. Such transit signals are on the order of 100 ppm. The high photometric precision demanded by Kepler requires detailed knowledge of how the Kepler pixels respond to starlight during a nominal observation. This information is provided by the Kepler pixel response function (PRF), defined as the composite of Kepler's optical
point-spread function, integrated spacecraft pointing jitter during a nominal cadence and other systematic effects. To provide sub-pixel resolution, the PRF is represented as a piecewise-continuous polynomial on a sub-pixel mesh. This continuous representation allows the
prediction of a star's flux value on any pixel given the star's pixel position. The advantages and difficulties of this polynomial
representation are discussed, including characterization of spatial variation in the PRF and the smoothing of discontinuities between sub-pixel polynomial patches. On-orbit super-resolution measurements of the PRF across the Kepler field of view are described. Two uses of the PRF are presented: the selection of pixels for each star that maximizes the photometric signal-to-noise ratio for that star, and PRF-fitted centroids which provide robust and accurate stellar positions on the CCD, primarily used for attitude and plate scale tracking. Good
knowledge of the PRF has been a critical component for the successful collection of high-precision photometry by Kepler.},

We then calibrate the morphological age indicator {$\delta$}(V), which can be obtained for all remaining clusters, in terms of age and metallicity. Particular care is taken to ensure consistency in the whole procedure. The resulting Open Cluster ages connect well to our previous Globular Cluster results. From the Open Cluster sample, as well as from the combined sample, questions regarding the formation process of Galactic components are addressed. The age of the oldest open clusters (NGC 6791 and Be 17) is of the order of 10 Gyr. We determine a delay by 2.0 {$\pm$} 1.5 Gyr between the start of the halo and thin disk formation, whereas thin and thick disk started to form approximately at the same time. We do not find any significant age\textendash{}metallicity relationship for the open cluster sample. The cumulative age distribution of the whole open cluster sample shows a moderately significant ({$\sim$}2{$\sigma$} level) departure from the predictions for an exponentially declining dissolution rate with timescale of 2.5 Gyr. The cumulative age distribution does not show any trend with galactocentric distance, but the clusters with larger height to the Galactic plane have an excess of objects between 2\textendash{}4 and 6 Gyr with respect to their counterpart closer to the plane of the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {We present an independent confirmation of the zero-point offset of Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) parallaxes using asteroseismic data of evolved stars in the Kepler field. Using well-characterized red giant branch (RGB) stars from the APOKASC-2 catalogue we identify a color- and magnitude-dependent zero-point offset of \$52.8 \textbackslash{}pm 2.4 (stat.) \textbackslash{}pm 1 (syst.) \textbackslash{}muas\$, in the sense that Gaia parallaxes are too small. The offset is present at nearly the same level in high and low extinction samples, and remains whether using Gaia DR2 or APOKASC-2 extinction estimates derived from SED fitting. The same exercise, performed with core He-burning red clump stars, yields an offset in the same sense of \$50.2 \textbackslash{}pm 2.5 (stat.) \textbackslash{}pm 1 (syst.) \textbackslash{}muas\$. We argue that the difference between these two measures likely reflects known systematic differences in the APOKASC-2 radius scale of RC and RGB stars at the \$1\textbackslash\%\$ level. We recommend adopting the RGB scale because the APOKASC-2 sample was calibrated on RGB stars. Because of possible spatially-correlated parallax errors, as discussed by the Gaia team, our zero-point solution is specific to the Kepler field, but broadly compatible with the global zero-point uncertainty inferred by the Gaia team and independent results using Cepheids. Additionally, there is evidence for a larger absolute offset error for smaller parallaxes, which we will explore in future work.},

  abstract = {We present this paper in conjunction with a companion paper as the first results in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Open Star Cluster Survey. This survey is a large BVR imaging data set of 19 open star clusters in our Galaxy. This data set was taken with the CFH12K mosaic CCD (42{${'}$} \texttimes{} 28{${'}$}), and the majority of the clusters were imaged under excellent photometric, subarcsecond seeing, conditions. The combination of multiple exposures extending to deep (V {$\sim$} 25) magnitudes with short ({$\leq$}10 s) frames allows for studies ranging from faint white dwarf stars to bright turnoff, variable, and red giant stars. The primary aim of this survey is to catalog the white dwarf stars in these clusters and establish observational constraints on the initial-final mass relationship for these stars and the upper mass limit to white dwarf production. Additionally, we hope to better determine the properties of the clusters, such as age and distance, and also test evolution and dynamical theories by analyzing luminosity and mass functions. In order to more easily incorporate these data in further studies, we have produced a catalog of positions, magnitudes, colors, and stellarity confidence for all stars in each cluster of the survey. This reduction, along with the computed calibration parameters for all three nights of the observing run will encourage others to use these data in different astrophysical studies outside of our goals. Additionally, the data set is reduced using the new TERAPIX photometric reduction package, PSFex, which is found to compare well with other packages. This paper is intended both as a source for the astronomical community to obtain information on the clusters in the survey and as a detailed reference of reduction procedures for further publications of individual clusters. We discuss the methods employed to reduce the data and compute the photometric catalog. We reserve both the scientific results for each individual cluster and global results from the study of the entire survey for future publications. The first of these further publications is devoted to the old rich open star cluster, NGC 6819, and appears as a companion paper in the same issue of the Journal.},

After a brief review of some of the pioneering work that established the importance of imaging stars in these systems, we focus on several recent studies that have challenged our fundamental picture of star clusters. These new studies indicate that star clusters can very well harbour multiple stellar populations, possibly formed through self-enrichment processes from the first-generation stars that evolved through post-main-sequence evolutionary phases. Correctly interpreting stellar evolution in such systems is tied to our understanding of both chemical-enrichment mechanisms, including stellar mass loss along the giant branches, and the dynamical state of the cluster. We illustrate recent imaging, spectroscopic and theoretical studies that have begun to shed new light on the evolutionary processes that occur within star clusters.},

  abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within {$\sim$}2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4\textendash{}7\% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M{$\odot$}. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70\textendash{}90\%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

Masses and radii are rarely constrained better than when measured via orbital dynamics and eclipse depths. Pulsating binaries have much to offer. They are clocks, moving in space, that encode orbital motion in the Doppler-shifted pulsation frequencies. They offer twice the opportunity to obtain an asteroseismic age, which is then applicable to both stars. They enable comparative asteroseismology -- the study of two stars by their pulsation properties, whose only fundamental differences are the mass and rotation rates with which they were born. In eccentric binaries, oscillations can be excited tidally, informing our knowledge of tidal dissipation and resonant frequency locking. Eclipsing binaries offer benchmarks against which the asteroseismic scaling relations can be tested. We review these themes in light of both observational and theoretical developments recently made possible by space-based photometry.},

  abstract = {Stellar populations contain the most important information about star cluster formation and evolution. Until several decades ago, star clusters were believed to be ideal laboratories for studies of simple stellar populations (SSPs). However, discoveries of multiple stellar populations in Galactic globular clusters have expanded our view on stellar populations in star clusters. They have simultaneously generated a number of controversies, particularly as to whether young star clusters may have the same origin as old globular clusters. In addition, extensive studies have revealed that the SSP scenario does not seem to hold for some intermediate-age and young star clusters either, thus making the origin of multiple stellar populations in star clusters even more complicated. Stellar population anomalies in numerous star clusters are well-documented, implying that the notion of star clusters as true SSPs faces serious challenges. In this review, we focus on stellar populations in massive clusters with different ages. We present the history and progress of research in this active field, as well as some of the most recent improvements, including observational results and scenarios that have been proposed to explain the observations. Although our current ability to determine the origin of multiple stellar populations in star clusters is unsatisfactory, we propose a number of promising projects that may contribute to a significantly improved understanding of this subject.},

  abstract = {The effect of metallicity on the granulation activity in stars is still poorly understood. Available spectroscopic parameters from the updated APOGEE-\textbackslash{}textit\{Kepler\} catalog, coupled with high-precision photometric observations from NASA's \textbackslash{}textit\{Kepler\} mission spanning more than four years of observation, make oscillating red giant stars in open clusters crucial testbeds. We determine the role of metallicity on the stellar granulation activity by discriminating its effect from that of different stellar properties such as surface gravity, mass, and temperature. We analyze 60 known red giant stars belonging to the open clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6819, and NGC 6811, spanning a metallicity range from [Fe/H] \$\textbackslash{}simeq -0.09\$ to \$0.32\$. The parameters describing the granulation activity of these stars and their \$\textbackslash{}nu\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{max\}\$, are studied by considering the different masses, metallicities, and stellar evolutionary stages. We derive new scaling relations for the granulation activity, re-calibrate existing ones, and identify the best scaling relations from the available set of observations. We adopted the Bayesian code DIAMONDS for the analysis of the background signal in the Fourier spectra of the stars. We performed a Bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison to test the different model hypotheses proposed in this work and in the literature. Metallicity causes a statistically significant change in the amplitude of the granulation activity, with a dependency stronger than that induced by both stellar mass and surface gravity. We also find that the metallicity has a significant impact on the corresponding time scales of the phenomenon. The effect of metallicity on the time scale is stronger than that of mass. A higher metallicity increases the amplitude of granulation and meso-granulation signals and slows down their characteristic time scales toward longer periods.},

Key to this time-stamping is the cluster NGC 6791, whose stellar members have mean abundances that place it in the high-\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$, high-[Fe/H] region of the [\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane. Based on the cluster's age (\$\textbackslash{}sim 8\$ Gyr), Galactocentric radius, and height above the Galactic plane, as well as comparable chemistry reported for APOGEE stars in Baade's Window, we suggest that the two most likely origins for NGC 6791 are as an original part of the thick-disk, or as a former member of the Galactic bulge. Moreover, because NGC 6791 lies at the \textbackslash{}textit\{high metallicity end\} ([Fe/H] \$\textbackslash{}sim 0.4\$) of the high-\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$ sequence, the age of NGC 6791 places a limit on the \textbackslash{}textit\{youngest age\} of stars in the high-metallicity, high-\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$ sequence for the cluster's parent population (i.e., either the bulge or the disk). In a similar way, we can also use the age and chemistry of NGC 188 to set a limit of \$\textbackslash{}sim 7\$ Gyr on the \textbackslash{}textit\{oldest age\} of the low-\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$ sequence of the Milky Way. Therefore, NGC 6791 and NGC 188 are potentially a pair of star clusters that bracket both the timing and the duration of an important transition point in the chemical history of the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {Stellar clusters form by gravitational collapse of turbulent molecular clouds, with up to several thousand stars per cluster. They are thought to be the birthplace of most stars and therefore play an important role in our understanding of star formation, a fundamental problem in astrophysics. The initial conditions of the molecular cloud establish its dynamical history until the stellar cluster is born. However, the evolution of the cloud's angular momentum during cluster formation is not well understood. Current observations have suggested that turbulence scrambles the angular momentum of the cluster-forming cloud, preventing spin alignment amongst stars within a cluster. Here we use asteroseismology to measure the inclination angles of spin axes in 48 stars from the two old open clusters NGC\textasciitilde{}6791 and NGC\textasciitilde{}6819. The stars within each cluster show strong alignment. Three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of proto-cluster formation show that at least 50 \% of the initial proto-cluster kinetic energy has to be rotational in order to obtain strong stellar-spin alignment within a cluster. Our result indicates that the global angular momentum of the cluster-forming clouds was efficiently transferred to each star and that its imprint has survived after several gigayears since the clusters formed.},

In particular, two distinct pointings have been obtained for each target on average, all centred at about \$6.5\$ arcmin from the cluster centre, thus covering a mean area of about \$23\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash{}rm arcmin\^\{2\}\}\$ for each globular cluster. For each field, at least one exposure in both F475W and F814W filters was collected. In this work, we publicly release the astrometric and photometric catalogues and the astrometrised atlases for each of these fields.},

  abstract = {We present a comparison between theoretical, frequency-dependent, damping rates and linewidths of radial-mode oscillations in red-giant stars located in the open cluster NGC 6819. The calculations adopt a time-dependent non-local convection model, with the turbulent pressure profile being calibrated to results of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar atmospheres. The linewidths are obtained from extensive peakbagging of Kepler lightcurves. These observational results are of unprecedented quality owing to the long continuous observations by Kepler. The uniqueness of the Kepler mission also means that, for asteroseismic properties, this is the best data that will be available for a long time to come. We therefore take great care in modelling nine RGB stars in NGC 6819 using information from 3D simulations to obtain realistic temperature stratifications and calibrated turbulent pressure profiles. Our modelled damping rates reproduce well the Kepler observations, including the characteristic depression in the linewidths around the frequency of maximum oscillation power. Furthermore, we thoroughly test the sensitivity of the calculated damping rates to changes in the parameters of the nonlocal convection model.},

High resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectroscopic data of stars in the helium-core-burning phase have been obtained with the FIES spectrograph on the NOT 2.56m telescope and the HIRES spectrograph on the Keck I 10 m telescope. They have been analyzed to determine the chemical abundances of four open clusters with close to solar metallicity; NGC 6811, NGC 6819, M67 and NGC 188. The abundances are derived from equivalent widths of spectral lines using ATLAS9 model atmospheres with parameters determined from the excitation and ionization balance of Fe lines. Results from asteroseismology and binary studies were used as priors on the atmospheric parameters, where especially the \$\textbackslash{}log g\$ is determined to much higher precision than what is possible with spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the four open clusters are close to solar metallicity and they follow the [Y/Mg] vs. age trend previously found for solar twins. The [Y/Mg] vs. age clock also works for giant stars in the helium-core burning phase, which vastly increases the possibilities to estimate the age of stars not only in the solar neighborhood, but in large parts of the Galaxy, due to the brighter nature of evolved stars compared to dwarfs.},

  abstract = {We present an extensive peakbagging effort on Kepler data of \$\textbackslash{}sim\$50 red giant stars in the open star cluster NGC 6819. By employing sophisticated pre-processing of the time series and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques we extracted individual frequencies, heights and linewidths for hundreds of oscillation modes. We show that the "average" asteroseismic parameter \$\textbackslash{}delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\{02\}\$, derived from these, can be used to distinguish the stellar evolutionary state between the red giant branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars. Masses and radii are estimated using asteroseismic scaling relations, both empirically corrected to obtain self-consistency as well as agreement with independent measures of distance, and using updated theoretical corrections. Remarkable agreement is found, allowing the evolutionary state of the giants to be determined exclusively from the empirical correction to the scaling relations. We find a mean mass of the RGB stars and RC stars in NGC 6819 to be \$1.61\textbackslash{}pm0.02\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$ and \$1.64\{\textbackslash{}pm\}0.02\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$, respectively. The difference \$\textbackslash{}Delta M=-0.03\textbackslash{}pm0.01\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$ is almost insensitive to systematics, suggesting very little RGB mass loss, if any. Stars that are outliers relative to the ensemble reveal overmassive members that likely evolved via mass-transfer in a blue straggler phase. We suggest that KIC 4937011, a low-mass Li-rich giant, is a cluster member in the RC phase that experienced very high mass-loss during its evolution. Such over- and undermassive stars need to be considered when studying field giants, since the true age of such stars cannot be known and there is currently no way to distinguish them from normal stars.},

Most of such determinations are, up to now, based on simple scaling relations involving the large frequency separation, \textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu, and the frequency of maximum power, \textbackslash{}nu\$\_\{max\}\$. In this work, we implement \textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu\textbackslash{} and the period spacing, \{\textbackslash{}Delta\}P, computed along detailed grids of stellar evolutionary tracks, into stellar isochrones and hence in a Bayesian method of parameter estimation. Tests with synthetic data reveal that masses and ages can be determined with typical precision of 5 and 19 per cent, respectively, provided precise seismic parameters are available. Adding independent information on the stellar luminosity, these values can decrease down to 3 and 10 per cent respectively. The application of these methods to NGC 6819 giants produces a mean age in agreement with those derived from isochrone fitting, and no evidence of systematic differences between RGB and RC stars. The age dispersion of NGC 6819 stars, however, is larger than expected, with at least part of the spread ascribable to stars that underwent mass-transfer events.},

  abstract = {As part of our study of the old (\textasciitilde{}2.5 Gyr) open cluster NGC 6819 in the Kepler field, we present photometric (Kepler and ground-based BVRcIc) and spectroscopic observations of the detached eclipsing binary WOCS 24009 (Auner 665; KIC 5023948) with a short orbital period of 3.6 days. WOCS 24009 is a triple-lined system, and we verify that the brightest star is physically orbiting the eclipsing binary using radial velocities and eclipse timing variations. The eclipsing binary components have masses M\_B =1.090+/-0.010 Msun and M\_C =1.075+/-0.013 Msun, and radii R\_B =1.095+/-0.007 Rsun and R\_C =1.057+/-0.008 Rsun. The bright non-eclipsing star resides at the cluster turnoff, and ultimately its mass will directly constrain the turnoff mass: our preliminary determination is M\_A =1.251+/-0.057 Msun. A careful examination of the light curves indicates that the fainter star in the eclipsing binary undergoes a very brief period of total eclipse, which enables us to precisely decompose the light of the three stars and place them in the color-magnitude diagram. We also present improved analysis of two previously discussed detached eclipsing stars in NGC 6819 (WOCS 40007 and WOCS 23009) en route to a combined determination of the cluster's distance modulus (m-M)\_V=12.38+/-0.04. Because this paper significantly increases the number of measured stars in the cluster, we can better constrain the age of the color-magnitude diagram to be 2.21+/-0.10+/-0.20 Gyr. Additionally, using all measured eclipsing binary star masses and radii, we constrain the age to 2.38+/-0.05+/-0.22 Gyr. The quoted uncertainties are estimates of measurement and systematic uncertainties (due to model physics differences and metal content), respectively.},

Formulae are obtained for the contribution of every star into the spatial density profile. The evaluation of spatial density profiles is tested against open-cluster models from N-body experiments with N = 500. Surface density profiles are derived for seven open clusters (NGC 1502, 1960, 2287, 2516, 2682, 6819 and 6939) using Two-Micron All-Sky Survey data and for different limiting magnitudes. The selection of an optimal kernel half-width is discussed. It is shown that open-cluster radius estimates hardly depend on the kernel half-width. Hints of stellar mass segregation and structural features indicating cluster non-stationarity in the regular force field are found. A comparison with other investigations shows that the data on open-cluster sizes are often underestimated. The existence of an extended corona around the open cluster NGC 6939 was confirmed. A combined function composed of the King density profile for the cluster core and the uniform sphere for the cluster corona is shown to be a better approximation of the surface radial density profile.The King function alone does not reproduce surface density profiles of sample clusters properly. The number of stars, the cluster masses and the tidal radii in the Galactic gravitational field for the sample clusters are estimated. It is shown that NGC 6819 and 6939 are extended beyond their tidal surfaces.},

  abstract = {Determining the level of chemical homogeneity in open clusters is of fundamental importance in the study of the evolution of star-forming clouds and that of the Galactic disk. Yet limiting the initial abundance spread in clusters has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining consistent spectroscopic abundances for different stellar types. Without reference to any specific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a homogeneous cluster is that it forms a one-dimensional sequence, with any differences between members due to variations in stellar mass and observational uncertainties. I present a novel method for investigating the abundance spread in open clusters that tests this one-dimensional hypothesis at the level of observed stellar spectra, rather than constraining homogeneity using derived abundances as traditionally done. Using high-resolution APOGEE spectra for 49 giants in M67, NGC 6819, and NGC 2420 I demonstrate that these spectra form one-dimensional sequences for each cluster. With detailed forward modeling of the spectra and Approximate Bayesian Computation, I derive strong limits on the initial abundance spread of 15 elements: {$<$}0.01 (0.02) dex for C and Fe, {$<\sptilde$}0.015 (0.03) dex for N, O, Mg, Si, and Ni, {$<\sptilde$}0.02 (0.03) dex for Al, Ca, and Mn, and {$<\sptilde$}0.03 (0.05) dex for Na, S, K, Ti, and V (at 68\% and 95\% confidence, respectively). The strong limits on C and O imply that no pollution by massive core-collapse supernovae occurred during star formation in open clusters, which, thus, need to form within {$<\sptilde$}6 Myr. Further development of this and related techniques will bring the power of differential abundances to stars other than solar twins in large spectroscopic surveys and will help unravel the history of star formation and chemical enrichment in the Milky Way through chemical tagging.},

For the MS stars we find [Fe/H] = \$+\$0.05 \$\textbackslash{}pm\$ 0.04 and [Ba/Fe] = \$-\$0.01 \$\textbackslash{}pm\$ 0.10. The majority of the BS stars are consistent with these values. We identify five BSs with significant barium enhancement. These stars most likely formed through mass transfer from an asymptotic giant branch star that polluted the surface of the BS with the nucleosynthesis products generated during thermal pulsations. This conclusion aligns with the results from the substantial work done on the BSs in old open cluster NGC 188 that identifies mass transfer as the dominant mechanism for BS formation in that open cluster. However, four of the BSs with enhanced barium show no radial-velocity evidence for a companion. The one star that is in a binary is a double-lined system, meaning the companion is not a white dwarf and not the remnant of a prior AGB star. In this paper we attempt to develop a consistent scenario to explain the origin of these five BSs.},

The currently favored model to explain Li enhancement in first-ascent red giants like 2M19411367+4003382 requires deep mixing into the stellar interior. Testing this model requires a measurement of 12C/13C, which is possible to obtain from APOGEE spectra. However, the Li-rich star also has abnormal asteroseismic properties that call into question its membership in the cluster, even though its radial velocity and location on color-magnitude diagrams are consistent with membership. To address these puzzles, we have measured a wide array of abundances in the Li-rich star and three comparison stars using spectra taken as part of the APOGEE survey to determine the degree of stellar mixing, address the question of membership, and measure the surface gravity. We confirm that the Li-rich star is a red giant with the same overall chemistry as the other cluster giants. However, its log g is significantly lower, consistent with the asteroseismology results and suggestive of a very low mass if the star is indeed a cluster member. Regardless of the cluster membership, the 12C/13C and C/N ratios of the Li-rich star are consistent with standard first dredge-up, indicating that Li dilution has already occurred, and inconsistent with internal Li enrichment scenarios that require deep mixing.},

Input temperature estimates for model atmosphere analysis are provided by (B-V) colors merged from several sources, with individual reddening corrections applied to each star relative to a cluster mean of E(B-V) = 0.16. Extensive use is made of ROBOSPECT, an automatic equivalent width measurement program; its effectiveness on large spectroscopic samples is discussed. From the sample of likely single members, [Fe/H] = -0.03 +/- 0.06, where the error describes the median absolute deviation about the sample median value, leading to an internal precision for the cluster below 0.01 dex. The final uncertainty in the cluster abundance is therefore dominated by external systematics due to the temperature scale, surface gravity, and microturbulent velocity, leading to [Fe/H] = -0.02 +/- 0.02 for a sub-sample restricted to main sequence and turnoff stars. This result is consistent with our recent intermediate-band photometric determination of a slightly subsolar abundance for this cluster. [Ca/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ni/Fe] are determined to be solar within the uncertainties. NGC 6819 has an abundance distribution typical of solar metallicity thin disk stars in the solar neighborhood.},

These pulsations arise due to the various ongoing physical phenomena of the variables. Moreover, pulsations of the variables are identified through the visual inspection of their frequency-amplitude distributions. A total of 18 variables among the 28 known variables are showing the secondary pulsation modes. Furthermore, these pulsation modes do not occur for PV, EA, EB, Elliptical and semi-regular. In addition, the field variables seem to be the red-component-stars (RCS) for the studied cluster. The smoothness of the frequency-amplitude curves, signal to noise ratio and the significant limits are play major role for deciding the real peak or frequency values. We are not rejected those amplitude peak of parabolic patterns, for which, the amplitude is greater than then significant limit of variables. The weight of pulsation frequencies is given to be 0.5 for non full cyclic variation but the amplitude is greater than significant limit. Similarly, our present analysis does not support the HADS characteristics of previous known HADS stars within stellar cluster NGC 6866. We are also proposed to new correlation between the secondary pulsation modes (depending frequencies) and the absolute magnitude of known variables.},

We extracted the frequencies of the radial and quadrupole modes from its frequency power spectrum and determined its properties using a grid of evolutionary models constructed with MESA. The oscillation frequencies were calculated using the GYRE code and the surface term was corrected using the Ball \& Gizon(2014) prescription. We find that the star has a mass of \$M/M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\} = 1.793\textbackslash{}pm 0.072\$, age \$t=1.48\textbackslash{}pm 0.21\$ Gyr and radius \$R/R\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\} = 10.53\textbackslash{}pm 0.28\$. By analyzing the internal structure of the best-fitting model, we infer the evolutionary status of the star KIC 8263801 as being on the ascending part of the red giant branch, and not on the red clump. This result is verified using a purely asteroseismic diagnostic, the \$\textbackslash{}epsilon\_\{c\}-\textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\{c\}\$ diagram which can distinguish red giant branch stars from red clump stars. Finally, by comparing its age with NGC 6866 (\$t=0.65 \textbackslash{}pm 0.1\$ Gyr) we conclude that KIC 8263801 is not a member of this open cluster.},

Two of the pulsators, a delta Sct star NGC 6866-29 and a gamma Dor star NGC6866-21, are multiperiodic. From an analysis of proper motions, we conclude that the delta Sct stars, one of the gamma Dor stars and both blue-stragglers are very probable members of the cluster. The position on the color-magnitude diagram of seven other variables suggests that they also belong to the cluster. The eclipsing binary, which we discover to be a new high-velocity star, and the seven irregular variables are non-members.

  abstract = {The NASA space telescope Kepler has provided unprecedented time-series observations which have revolutionised the field of asteroseismology, i.e. the use of stellar oscillations to probe the interior of stars. The Kepler-data include observations of stars in open clusters, which are particularly interesting for asteroseismology. One of the clusters observed with Kepler is NGC 6811, which is the target of the present paper. However, apart from high-precision time-series observations, sounding the interiors of stars in open clusters by means of asteroseismology also requires accurate and precise atmospheric parameters as well as cluster membership indicators for the individual stars. We use medium-resolution (R\textasciitilde{}25,000) spectroscopic observations, and three independent analysis methods, to derive effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, projected rotational velocities and radial velocities, for 15 stars in the field of the open cluster NGC 6811. We discover two double-lined and three single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Eight stars are classified as either certain or very probable cluster members, and three stars are classified as non-members. For four stars, cluster membership could not been assessed. Five of the observed stars are G-type giants which are located in the colour-magnitude diagram in the region of the red clump of the cluster. Two of these stars are surely identified as red clump stars for the first time. For those five stars, we provide chemical abundances of 31 elements. The mean radial-velocity of NGC 6811 is found to be +6.68\$\textbackslash{}pm\$0.08 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ and the mean metallicity and overall abundance pattern are shown to be very close to solar with an exception of Ba which we find to be overabundant.},

Ensemble \textbackslash{}'\{e\}chelle diagrams and upper limits to the linewidths of l = 0 modes as a function of \textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu of the clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 6819 are also shown, together with the correlation between the l = 0 ridge width and the T\_eff of the stars.

These seismic results also allow us to identify a number of special cases, including evolved blue stragglers and binaries, as well as stars in late He-core burning phases, which can be potentially interesting targets for detailed theoretical modeling.},

  abstract = {The successful launches of the CoRoT and Kepler space missions have led to the detections of solar-like oscillations in large samples of red-giant stars. The large numbers of red giants with observed oscillations make it possible to investigate the properties of the sample as a whole: ensemble asteroseismology. In this article we summarise ensemble asteroseismology results obtained from data released by the Kepler Science Team (\textasciitilde{}150,000 field stars) as presented by Hekker et al. (2011b) and for the clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6811 and NGC 6819 (Hekker et al. 2011a) and we discuss the importance of such studies.},

The primary is a metal-lined Am star with a possible convective blueshift to its radial velocities, and one star (probably the secondary) is likely to be a \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ Dor pulsator. The component masses are \$1.603\textbackslash{}pm0.006\$(stat.)\$\textbackslash{}pm0.016\$(sys.) and \$1.419\textbackslash{}pm0.003\textbackslash{}pm0.008 M\_\textbackslash{}odot\$, and the radii are \$1.744\textbackslash{}pm0.004\textbackslash{}pm0.002\$ and \$1.544\textbackslash{}pm0.002\textbackslash{}pm0.002 R\_\textbackslash{}odot\$. The isochrone ages of the stars are mildly inconsistent: the age from the mass-radius combination for the primary (\$1.05\textbackslash{}pm0.05\textbackslash{}pm0.09\$ Gyr, where the last quote was systematic uncertainty from models and metallicity) is smaller than that from the secondary (\$1.21\textbackslash{}pm0.05\textbackslash{}pm0.15\$ Gyr) and is consistent with the inference from the color-magnitude diagram (\$1.00\textbackslash{}pm0.05\$ Gyr). We have improved the measurements of the asteroseismic parameters \$\textbackslash{}Delta \textbackslash{}nu\$ and \$\textbackslash{}nu\_\{\textbackslash{}rm max\}\$ for helium-burning stars in the cluster. The masses of the stars appear to be larger (or alternately, the radii appear to be smaller) than predicted from isochrones using the ages derived from the eclipsing stars. The majority of stars near the cluster turnoff are pulsating stars: we identify a sample of 28 \$\textbackslash{}delta\$ Sct, 15 \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ Dor, and 5 hybrid types. We used the period-luminosity relation for high-amplitude \$\textbackslash{}delta\$ Sct stars to fit the ensemble of the strongest frequencies for the cluster members, finding \$(m-M)\_V = 10.37\textbackslash{}pm0.03\$. This is larger than most previous determinations, but smaller than values derived from the eclipsing binary (\$10.47\textbackslash{}pm0.05\$).},

The core radius of the cluster is found to be \$r\_\{c\}\$=3.60 arcmin. The astrophysical parameters were determined simultaneously via Bayesian statistics using the colour-magnitude diagrams V versus B-V, V versus V-I, V versus V-R, and V versus R-I of the cluster. The resulting most likely parameters were further confirmed using independent methods, removing any possible degeneracies.

  abstract = {Context: Four open clusters are present in the Kepler field of view and timeseries of nearly a year in length are now available. These timeseries allow us to derive asteroseismic global oscillation parameters of red-giant stars in the three open clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6819 and NGC 6811. From these parameters and effective temperatures, we derive mass, radii and luminosities for the clusters as well as field red giants. Aims: We study the influence of evolution and metallicity on the observed red-giant populations. Methods: The global oscillation parameters are derived using different published methods and the effective temperatures are derived from 2MASS colours. The observational results are compared with BaSTI evolution models. Results: We find that the mass has significant influence on the asteroseismic quantities delta\_nu vs. nu\_max relation, while the influence of metallicity is negligible, under the assumption that the metallicity does not affect the excitation / damping of the oscillations. The positions of the stars in the H-R diagram depend on both mass and metallicity. Furthermore, the stellar masses derived for the field stars are bracketed by those of the cluster stars. Conclusions: Both the mass and metallicity contribute to the observed difference in locations in the H-R diagram of the old metal-rich cluster NGC 6791 and the middle-aged solar-metallicity cluster NGC 6819. For the young cluster NGC 6811, the explanation of the position of the stars in the H-R diagram challenges the assumption of solar metallicity, and this open cluster might have significantly lower metallicity [Fe/H] in the range -0.3 to -0.7 dex. Also, nearly all the observed field stars seem to be older than NGC 6811 and younger than NGC 6791.},

Using Gaia DR2 proper motions and parallax measurements we are able to select a clean sample of cluster members. This cluster displays a clear extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO), a phenomenon previously studied mainly in young and intermediate age massive clusters in the Magellanic clouds. The main sequence of NGC\textasciitilde{}2818 is extremely narrow, with a width of \$\textbackslash{}sim0.01\$ magnitudes (G\$\_\{\textbackslash{}rm BP\} - \$ G\$\_\{\textbackslash{}rm RP\}\$), suggesting very low levels of differential extinction. Using VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy of 60 cluster members to measure the rotational velocity of the stars (Vsini) we find that stars on the red side of the eMSTO have high Vsini (\${$>$}160\$\textasciitilde{}km/s) while stars on the blue side have low Vsini (\${$<$}160\$\textasciitilde{}km/s), in agreement with model predictions. The cluster also follows the previously discovered trend between the age of the cluster and the extent of the eMSTO. We conclude that stellar rotation is the likely cause of the eMSTO phenomenon.},

(iii) The presence of the Blazhko effect was carefully checked and identified one new Blazhko candidate but for at least 16 stars the effect can be excluded. This fact has important consequences. Either the cycle-to-cycle variation phenomenon is independent from the Blazhko effect and the Blazhko incidence ratio is still much lower (51\%-55\%) than the extremely large ({$>$}90\%) ratio published recently. The connection between the extra modes and the cycle-to-cycle variations is marginal.},

  abstract = {A new perspective of pulsation in stars within the {$\delta$} Scuti instability strip has recently emerged as a result of Kepler
observations. The majority of stars within the instability strip do not pulsate and practically all {$\delta$} Scuti stars contain low frequencies. Because {$\gamma$} Doradus stars co-exist with {$\delta$} Sct stars in the
same region of the instability strip, it follows that {$\gamma$} Dor stars are driven by the same mechanism as {$\delta$} Sct stars. The difference
must be due to different mode selection processes. The search for an unknown damping factor which is missing from the models will be
essential for further progress. Maia variables and hot {$\gamma$} Dor stars are briefly discussed. Luminosities of roAp stars obtained from Gaia DR2 parallaxes and spectroscopic effective temperatures show that the roAp stars are slightly evolved with temperatures in the range
6300\textendash{}8300 K, considerably cooler than predicted by the models. The roAp stars and stars with solar-like oscillations share the same mass - temperature - luminosity relation, but with frequencies which are about 50 percent higher. This suggests that roAp frequencies are determined by the critical acoustic frequency, but this frequency is larger than in standard models, perhaps as a result of a temperature inversion in the atmosphere.},

short cadence B-band observations of an roAp star previously lacking
detailed study. Our observations confirm the rotation period presented
in the discovery paper of this star (Prot = 3.0918 d), and
reveal the star to be pulsating in a distorted mode. The B data show
this star to be among the highest amplitude roAp stars, with a
peak-to-peak amplitude of 24 mmag. Modelling of the pulsation frequency
at 197.2714 d-1 (2283 {$\mu$}Hz; P = 7.30 min) shows that this
star belongs to the subgroup of super-critical pulsators, where the
observed frequencies are above the theoretical acoustic cutoff
frequency. From the modelling, we deduce that the star's rotation axis
is inclination angle of about 30\textdegree{} to the line of sight, with an
angle of obliquity of the magnetic axis to the rotation axis of either
40\textdegree{} or 24\textdegree{} depending on whether the pulsation mode is dipole or

  abstract = {We present the analysis of K2 short cadence data of the rapidly 
oscillating Ap (roAp) star, 33 Librae (HD 137949). The precision
afforded to the K2 data allow us to identify at least 11 pulsation modes
in this star, compared to the three previously reported. Reoccurring
separations between these modes lead us to suggest a large frequency
separation, {$\Delta\nu$}, of 78.9 {$\mu$} Hz, twice that reported in the
literature. Other frequency separations we detect may represent the
small frequency separation, {$\delta\nu$}, but this is inconclusive at
this stage due to magnetic perturbation of the frequencies. Due to the
highly non-linear pulsation in 33 Lib, we identify harmonics to four
times the principal frequency. Furthermore, we note a unique occurrence
of non-linear interactions of the 11 identified modes. The frequency
separations of the modes around the principal frequency are replicated
around the first harmonic, with some interaction with the second
harmonic also. Such a phenomenon has not been seen in roAp stars before.
With revised stellar parameters, linear non-adiabatic modelling of 33
Lib shows that the pulsations are not greater than the acoustic cutoff
frequency, and that the {$\kappa$}-mechanism can excite the observed modes.
Our observations are consistent with 33 Lib having a rotation period
much larger than 88 d as presented in the literature.},

Further calculations demonstrate that most short period systems will synchronize their orbits during the Main Sequence, then evolve to circular orbits in the sub-giant phase. The distortions which can be expected along the centerlines of stars in the Main Sequence is described analytically, noting that the distortion takes the form of an expansion into the Roche lobe. The models are used to generate light curves for suspected ellipsoidal variables, e.g., beta Lyrae, with satisfactory results. Similarly, the spectroscopic signatures of ellipsoidal systems exhibit dual peaked features which vary, a characteristic which can also be understood in terms of the filling of the Roche lobe.},

  volume = {368},
  abstract = {Open and globular star clusters have served as benchmarks for the study of stellar evolution owing to their supposed nature as simple stellar populations of the same age and metallicity. After a brief review of some of the pioneering work that established the importance of imaging stars in these systems, we focus on several recent studies that have challenged our fundamental picture of star clusters. These new studies indicate that star clusters can very well harbour multiple stellar populations, possibly formed through self-enrichment processes from the first-generation stars that evolved through post-main-sequence evolutionary phases. Correctly interpreting stellar evolution in such systems is tied to our understanding of both chemical-enrichment mechanisms, including stellar mass loss along the giant branches, and the dynamical state of the cluster. We illustrate recent imaging, spectroscopic and theoretical studies that have begun to shed new light on the evolutionary processes that occur within star clusters.},

  abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within {$\sim$}2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4\textendash{}7\% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M{$\odot$}. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70\textendash{}90\%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

  shorttitle = {The {{Initial}}-{{Final Mass Relation}}},
  abstract = {The initial-final mass relation represents a mapping between the mass of a white dwarf remnant and the mass that the hydrogen-burning main-sequence star that created it once had. The empirical relation thus far has been constrained using a sample of 40 stars in young open clusters, ranging in initial mass from 2.75 to 7 M{$\Sun$}, and shows a general trend that connects higher mass main-sequence stars with higher mass white dwarfs. In this paper, we present CFHT CFH12K photometric and Keck LRIS multiobject spectroscopic observations of a sample of 22 white dwarfs in two older open clusters, NGC 7789 (t = 1.4 Gyr) and NGC 6819 (t = 2.5 Gyr). We measure masses for the highest signal-to-noise ratio spectra by fitting the Balmer lines to atmosphere models and place the first direct constraints on the low-mass end of the initial-final mass relation. Our results indicate that the observed general trend at higher masses continues down to low masses, with Minitial = 1.6 M{$\Sun$} main-sequence stars forming Mfinal = 0.54 M{$\Sun$} white dwarfs. When added to our new data from the very old cluster NGC 6791, the relation is extended down to Minitial = 1.16 M{$\Sun$} (corresponding to Mfinal = 0.53 M{$\Sun$}). This extension of the relation represents a fourfold increase in the total number of hydrogen-burning stars for which the integrated mass loss can now be calculated from empirical data, assuming a Salpeter initial mass function. The new leverage at the low-mass end is used to derive a purely empirical initial-final mass relation. The sample of white dwarfs in these clusters also shows several interesting systems that we discuss further: a DB (helium) white dwarf, a magnetic white dwarf, a DAB (mixed hydrogen/helium atmosphere or a double degenerate DA+DB) white dwarf(s), and two possible equal-mass DA double degenerate binary systems.},

  abstract = {We present this paper in conjunction with a companion paper as the first results in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Open Star Cluster Survey. This survey is a large BVR imaging data set of 19 open star clusters in our Galaxy. This data set was taken with the CFH12K mosaic CCD (42{${'}$} \texttimes{} 28{${'}$}), and the majority of the clusters were imaged under excellent photometric, subarcsecond seeing, conditions. The combination of multiple exposures extending to deep (V {$\sim$} 25) magnitudes with short ({$\leq$}10 s) frames allows for studies ranging from faint white dwarf stars to bright turnoff, variable, and red giant stars. The primary aim of this survey is to catalog the white dwarf stars in these clusters and establish observational constraints on the initial-final mass relationship for these stars and the upper mass limit to white dwarf production. Additionally, we hope to better determine the properties of the clusters, such as age and distance, and also test evolution and dynamical theories by analyzing luminosity and mass functions. In order to more easily incorporate these data in further studies, we have produced a catalog of positions, magnitudes, colors, and stellarity confidence for all stars in each cluster of the survey. This reduction, along with the computed calibration parameters for all three nights of the observing run will encourage others to use these data in different astrophysical studies outside of our goals. Additionally, the data set is reduced using the new TERAPIX photometric reduction package, PSFex, which is found to compare well with other packages. This paper is intended both as a source for the astronomical community to obtain information on the clusters in the survey and as a detailed reference of reduction procedures for further publications of individual clusters. We discuss the methods employed to reduce the data and compute the photometric catalog. We reserve both the scientific results for each individual cluster and global results from the study of the entire survey for future publications. The first of these further publications is devoted to the old rich open star cluster, NGC 6819, and appears as a companion paper in the same issue of the Journal.},

  abstract = {NGC 6791 is a unique stellar system; it is both one of the oldest and 
most metal-rich open clusters in our Galaxy. Recently, a deep Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) imaging study of its white dwarf (WD) population
has led to the puzzling conclusion that the cluster is only 2.4 Gyr old
(the main-sequence turnoff age is {$>$}8 Gyr). To explain this
discrepancy, it has been proposed that a fraction of the red giant
branch stars in NGC 6791 may have lost enough mass during their ascent
(due to the high metallicity, [Fe/H] \texttildelow{} +0.4) to avoid the helium
(He) flash. Therefore, a fraction of the WD population in this cluster
may not be canonical Carbon-Oxygen (C-O) core stars and rather be
undermassive He-core stars. To test this, we obtained Keck/LRIS
spectroscopy of a dozen bright WDs in NGC 6791 and measured their masses
from Balmer line fitting. Our results indicate that most of the bright
WDs in NGC 6791 are in fact undermassive and therefore were likely
formed from this unique evolutionary channel.},

  abstract = {We present analysis of deep CCD photometry for the very rich, old open 
star cluster NGC 6819. The science goals are to catalog the white dwarfs
in the cluster and measure the cluster luminosity and mass functions.
These CFH12K data results represent the first of nineteen open star
clusters which were imaged as a part of the CFHT Open Star Cluster
Survey. We find a tight, very rich, main-sequence and turnoff consisting
of over 2900 cluster stars in the V, B-V color-magnitude diagram (CMD).
Main-sequence fitting of the unevolved cluster stars with the Hyades
star cluster yields a distance modulus of
(m-M)V=12.30+/-0.12, for a reddening of E(B-V)=0.10. These
values are consistent with a newly calculated theoretical stellar
isochrone of age 2.5 Gyr, which we take to be the age of the cluster.
Both the depth gained in the photometry and the increased projected area
of the CFH12K Mosaic CCD allow for detailed star counts in concentric
annuli out to large angular radii. These indicate a much larger cluster
extent (R=9.5-+/-1.0-), by a factor of \textasciitilde{}2 over some previous
estimates. Incompleteness tests confirm a slightly negatively sloped
luminosity function extending to faint (V\textasciitilde{}23) magnitudes which is
indicative of a dynamically evolved cluster. Further luminosity function
and mass segregation tests indicate that low-mass objects (M{$<$}=0.65
Msolar) predominate in the outer regions of the cluster,
3.5-{$<$}=R{$<$}=9.5-. The estimation of the number of white
dwarfs in NGC 6819, based on stellar evolution models, white dwarf
cooling timescales, and conservation of star number arguments applied to
the red giant stars of the cluster are in good agreement with the
observed number. For those white dwarf candidates which pass both a
statistical subtraction that removes background galaxies and field stars
and a high star/galaxy confidence by using image classification, we show
comparisons with white dwarf isochrones and cooling models which suggest
the need for spectroscopy to confirm the white dwarf nature of the
brighter objects. This is entirely feasible for all objects, before a
statistical subtraction cut, with the current generation of 8 m-class
telescopes and multiobject spectrometers.},

  abstract = {We present the first detailed study of the properties (temperatures, 
gravities, and masses) of the NGC 6791 white dwarf population. This
unique stellar system is both one of the oldest (8 Gyr) and most
metal-rich ([Fe/H]\textasciitilde{}+0.4) open clusters in our Galaxy and has a
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) that exhibits both a red giant clump and a
much hotter extreme horizontal branch. Fitting the Balmer lines of the
white dwarfs in the cluster using Keck/LRIS spectra suggests that most
of these stars are undermassive, =0.43+/-0.06
Msolar, and therefore could not have formed from canonical
stellar evolution involving the helium flash at the tip of the red giant
branch. We show that at least 40\% of NGC 6791's evolved stars must have
lost enough mass on the red giant branch to avoid the flash and
therefore did not convert helium into carbon-oxygen in their core. Such
increased mass loss in the evolution of the progenitors of these stars
is consistent with the presence of the extreme horizontal branch in the
CMD. This unique stellar evolutionary channel also naturally explains
the recent finding of a very young age (2.4 Gyr) for NGC 6791 from white
dwarf cooling theory; helium-core white dwarfs in this cluster will cool
\textasciitilde{}3 times slower than carbon-oxygen-core stars, and therefore the
corrected white dwarf cooling age is in fact {$>\sptilde$}7 Gyr, consistent with
the well-measured main-sequence turnoff age. These results provide
direct empirical evidence that mass loss is much more efficient in
high-metallicity environments and therefore may be critical in
interpreting the ultraviolet upturn in elliptical galaxies.

While a link to the formation of GCs in dwarf galaxies has been suggested, present-day dwarf galaxies are not representative of the gravitational potential wells within which the GCs formed. Instead, a formation deep within the proto-Galaxy or within dark-matter mini-haloes might be favoured. Not all GCs may have formed and evolved similarly.

Masses and radii are rarely constrained better than when measured via orbital dynamics and eclipse depths. Pulsating binaries have much to offer. They are clocks, moving in space, that encode orbital motion in the Doppler-shifted pulsation frequencies. They offer twice the opportunity to obtain an asteroseismic age, which is then applicable to both stars. They enable comparative asteroseismology -- the study of two stars by their pulsation properties, whose only fundamental differences are the mass and rotation rates with which they were born. In eccentric binaries, oscillations can be excited tidally, informing our knowledge of tidal dissipation and resonant frequency locking. Eclipsing binaries offer benchmarks against which the asteroseismic scaling relations can be tested. We review these themes in light of both observational and theoretical developments recently made possible by space-based photometry.},

of astrophysical topics, from the properties of the Galactic disc to
stellar-evolution models. Knowing their metallicity and possibly
detailed chemical abundances is therefore important. However, the number
of systems with chemical abundances determined from high-resolution
spectroscopy remains small. Aims: Our aim is to increase the
number of open clusters with radial velocities and chemical abundances
determined from high-resolution spectroscopy using publicly available
catalogues of surveys in combination with Gaia data. Methods:
Open cluster stars have been identified in the APOGEE and GALAH
spectroscopic surveys by cross-matching their latest data releases with
stars for which high-probability astrometric membership has been derived
in many clusters on the basis of the Gaia second data release. 
Results: Radial velocities were determined for 131 and 14 clusters from
APOGEE and GALAH data, respectively. This is the first radial-velocity
determination from high-resolution spectra for 16 systems. Iron
abundances were obtained for 90 and 14 systems from APOGEE and GALAH
samples, respectively. To our knowledge 66 of these clusters (57 in
APOGEE and 9 in GALAH) do not have previous determinations in the
literature. For 90 and 7 clusters in the APOGEE and GALAH samples,
respectively, we also determined average abundances for Na, Mg, Al, Si,
Ca, Cr, Mn, and Ni.

  abstract = {Stellar populations contain the most important information about star cluster formation and evolution. Until several decades ago, star clusters were believed to be ideal laboratories for studies of simple stellar populations (SSPs). However, discoveries of multiple stellar populations in Galactic globular clusters have expanded our view on stellar populations in star clusters. They have simultaneously generated a number of controversies, particularly as to whether young star clusters may have the same origin as old globular clusters. In addition, extensive studies have revealed that the SSP scenario does not seem to hold for some intermediate-age and young star clusters either, thus making the origin of multiple stellar populations in star clusters even more complicated. Stellar population anomalies in numerous star clusters are well-documented, implying that the notion of star clusters as true SSPs faces serious challenges. In this review, we focus on stellar populations in massive clusters with different ages. We present the history and progress of research in this active field, as well as some of the most recent improvements, including observational results and scenarios that have been proposed to explain the observations. Although our current ability to determine the origin of multiple stellar populations in star clusters is unsatisfactory, we propose a number of promising projects that may contribute to a significantly improved understanding of this subject.},

velocities with a typical accuracy of 0.1 km s-1 for 336 215
of these stars, achievable due to the large wavelength coverage, high
resolving power, and good signal-to-noise ratio of the observed spectra,
but also because convective motions in stellar atmosphere and
gravitational redshift from the star to the observer are taken into
account. In the process we derive medians of observed spectra that are
nearly noiseless, as they are obtained from between 100 and 1116
observed spectra belonging to the same bin with a width of 50 K in
temperature, 0.2 dex in gravity, and 0.1 dex in metallicity. Publicly
released 1181 median spectra have a resolving power of 28 000 and trace
the well-populated stellar types with metallicities between -0.6 and
+0.3. Note that radial velocities from GALAH are an excellent match to
the accuracy of velocity components along the sky plane derived by Gaia
for the same stars. The level of accuracy achieved here is adequate for
studies of dynamics within stellar clusters, associations, and streams
in the Galaxy. So it may be relevant for studies of the distribution of
dark matter.},

Usually, this prior represents beliefs about the stellar density distribution of the Milky Way.

Here, we use 2MASS colors for 1.4 million TGAS stars to build a
noise-deconvolved empirical prior distribution for stars in
color\textendash{}magnitude space. This model contains no knowledge of stellar astrophysics or the Milky Way but is precise because it accurately generates a large number of noisy parallax measurements under an assumption of stationarity; that is, it is capable of combining the information from many stars. We use the Extreme Deconvolution (XD) algorithm\textemdash{}which is an empirical-Bayes approximation to a
full-hierarchical model of the true parallax and photometry of every star\textemdash{}to construct this prior. The prior is combined with a TGAS
likelihood to infer a precise photometric-parallax estimate and
uncertainty (and full posterior) for every star. Our parallax estimates are more precise than the TGAS catalog entries by a median factor of 1.2 (14\% are more precise by a factor {$>$}2) and they are more precise than the previous Bayesian distance estimates that use spatial priors. We validate our parallax inferences using members of the Milky Way star cluster M67, which is not visible as a cluster in the TGAS parallax estimates but appears as a cluster in our posterior parallax estimates. Our results, including a parallax posterior probability distribution function for each of 1.4 million TGAS stars, are available in companion electronic tables.},

  abstract = {NGC 6791 is a unique stellar cluster, key to our understanding of both the multiple stellar population phenomenon and the evolution and assembly of the Galaxy. However, despite many investigations, its nature is still very controversial. Geisler et al. (2012) found evidence suggesting it was the first open cluster to possess multiple populations but several subsequent studies did not corroborate this. It has also been considered a member of the thin or thick disk or even the bulge, and both as an open or globular cluster or even the remnant of a dwarf galaxy. Here, we present and discuss detailed abundances derived from high resolution spectra obtained with UVES at VLT and HIRES at Keck of 17 evolved stars of this cluster. We obtained a mean [Fe/H]=+0.313+-0.005, in good agreement with recent estimates, and with no indication of star-to-star metallicity variation, as expected. We also did not find any variation in Na, in spite of having selected the very same stars as in Geisler et al. (2012), where a Na variation was claimed. This points to the presence of probable systematics in the lower resolution spectra of this very high metallicity cluster analysed in that work. In fact, we find no evidence for an intrinsic spread in any element, corroborating recent independent APOGEE data. The derived abundances indicate that NGC 6791 very likely formed in the Galactic Bulge and that the proposed association with the Thick Disk is unlikely, despite its present Galactic location. We confirm the most recent hypothesis suggesting that the cluster could have formed in the Bulge and radially migrated to its current location, which appears the best explanation for this intriguing object.},

  abstract = {Context. Oscillation modes with a mixed character, as observed in 
evolved low-mass stars, are highly sensitive to the physical properties
of the innermost regions. Measuring their properties is therefore
extremely important to probe the core, but requires some care, due to
the complexity of the mixed-mode pattern. Aims: The aim of this
work is to provide a consistent description of the mixed-mode pattern of
low-mass stars, based on the asymptotic expansion. We also study the
variation of the gravity offset {$\varepsilon$}g with stellar
evolution. Methods: We revisit previous works about mixed modes
in red giants and empirically test how period spacings, rotational
splittings, mixed-mode widths, and heights can be estimated in a
consistent view, based on the properties of the mode inertia ratios. Results: From the asymptotic fit of the mixed-mode pattern of a large
set of red giants at various evolutionary stages, we derive unbiased and
precise asymptotic parameters. As the asymptotic expansion of gravity
modes is verified with a precision close to the frequency resolution for
stars on the red giant branch (10-4 in relative values), we
can derive accurate values of the asymptotic parameters. We decipher the
complex pattern in a rapidly rotating star, and explain how asymmetrical
splittings can be inferred. We also revisit the stellar inclinations in
two open clusters, NGC 6819 and NGC 6791: our results show that the
stellar inclinations in these clusters do not have privileged
orientation in the sky. The variation of the asymptotic gravity offset
with stellar evolution is investigated in detail. We also derive generic
properties that explain under which conditions mixed modes can be
observed.

Totalling about \$0.3\$ square degrees of observed sky, this is the largest homogeneous Hubble Space Telescope photometric survey of Galalctic globular clusters outskirts to date. In particular, two distinct pointings have been obtained for each target on average, all centred at about \$6.5\$ arcmin from the cluster centre, thus covering a mean area of about \$23\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash{}rm arcmin\^\{2\}\}\$ for each globular cluster. For each field, at least one exposure in both F475W and F814W filters was collected. In this work, we publicly release the astrometric and photometric catalogues and the astrometrised atlases for each of these fields.},

  abstract = {We present a comparison between theoretical, frequency-dependent, damping rates and linewidths of radial-mode oscillations in red-giant stars located in the open cluster NGC 6819. The calculations adopt a time-dependent non-local convection model, with the turbulent pressure profile being calibrated to results of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar atmospheres. The linewidths are obtained from extensive peakbagging of Kepler lightcurves. These observational results are of unprecedented quality owing to the long continuous observations by Kepler. The uniqueness of the Kepler mission also means that, for asteroseismic properties, this is the best data that will be available for a long time to come. We therefore take great care in modelling nine RGB stars in NGC 6819 using information from 3D simulations to obtain realistic temperature stratifications and calibrated turbulent pressure profiles. Our modelled damping rates reproduce well the Kepler observations, including the characteristic depression in the linewidths around the frequency of maximum oscillation power. Furthermore, we thoroughly test the sensitivity of the calculated damping rates to changes in the parameters of the nonlocal convection model.},

  abstract = {We present an extensive peakbagging effort on Kepler data of \$\textbackslash{}sim\$50 red giant stars in the open star cluster NGC 6819. By employing sophisticated pre-processing of the time series and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques we extracted individual frequencies, heights and linewidths for hundreds of oscillation modes. We show that the "average" asteroseismic parameter \$\textbackslash{}delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\{02\}\$, derived from these, can be used to distinguish the stellar evolutionary state between the red giant branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars. Masses and radii are estimated using asteroseismic scaling relations, both empirically corrected to obtain self-consistency as well as agreement with independent measures of distance, and using updated theoretical corrections. Remarkable agreement is found, allowing the evolutionary state of the giants to be determined exclusively from the empirical correction to the scaling relations. We find a mean mass of the RGB stars and RC stars in NGC 6819 to be \$1.61\textbackslash{}pm0.02\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$ and \$1.64\{\textbackslash{}pm\}0.02\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$, respectively. The difference \$\textbackslash{}Delta M=-0.03\textbackslash{}pm0.01\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$ is almost insensitive to systematics, suggesting very little RGB mass loss, if any. Stars that are outliers relative to the ensemble reveal overmassive members that likely evolved via mass-transfer in a blue straggler phase. We suggest that KIC 4937011, a low-mass Li-rich giant, is a cluster member in the RC phase that experienced very high mass-loss during its evolution. Such over- and undermassive stars need to be considered when studying field giants, since the true age of such stars cannot be known and there is currently no way to distinguish them from normal stars.},

A plate of stars in the Kepler field were observed in May of 2018 with the medium-resolution spectrographs of LAMOST, aiming to test the performance of this new system which is the upgraded equipment of LAMOST after the first five-year regular survey.We present our analysis on the radial velocity measurements (RVs) derived from these data. The results show that slight and significant systematic errors exist among the RVs obtained from the spectra collected by different spectrographs and exposures, respectively. After correcting the systematic errors with different techniques, the precision of RVs reaches \textasciitilde{}1.3, \textasciitilde{}1.0, \textasciitilde{}0.5 and \textasciitilde{}0.3 km/s at S/Nr = 10, 20, 50, and 100, respectively. Comparing with the RVs of the standard stars of the APOGEE survey, our RVs are calibrated with a zero-point shift of \textasciitilde{}7 km/s. The results indicate that the LAMOST medium-resolution spectroscopic system may provide RVs in a reasonable accuracy and precision for the selected targets.},

As survey astronomy continues to grow, the size and complexity of astronomical databases will increase, and the ability of astronomers to manually scour data and make such discoveries decreases. In this work, we introduce a machine learning-based method to identify anomalies in large datasets to facilitate such discoveries, and apply this method to long cadence lightcurves from NASA's Kepler Mission. Our method clusters data based on density, identifying anomalies as data that lie outside of dense regions. This work serves as a proof-of-concept case study and we test our method on four quarters of the Kepler long cadence lightcurves. We use Kepler's most notorious anomaly, Boyajian's Star (KIC 8462852), as a rare `ground truth' for testing outlier identification to verify that objects of genuine scientific interest are included among the identified anomalies. We evaluate the method's ability to identify known anomalies by identifying unusual behavior in Boyajian's Star, we report the full list of identified anomalies for these quarters, and present a sample subset of identified outliers that includes unusual phenomena, objects that are rare in the Kepler field, and data artifacts. By identifying {$<$}4\% of each quarter as outlying data, we demonstrate that this anomaly detection method can create a more targeted approach in searching for rare and novel phenomena.},

To explore if we can quantify an activity-age relation in the form of a flaring-age relation, we measured trends in the flaring rates and energies for stars with different masses and ages. We investigated the time-domain photometry provided by Kepler's follow-up mission K2 and searched for flares in three solar metallicity open clusters with well-known ages, M45 (0.125 Gyr), M44 (0.63 Gyr), and M67 (4.3 Gyr). We updated and employed the automated flare finding and analysis pipeline Appaloosa, originally designed for Kepler. We introduced a synthetic flare injection and recovery subroutine to ascribe detection and energy recovery rates for flares in a broad energy range for each light curve. We collected a sample of 1 761 stars, mostly late-K to mid-M dwarfs and found 751 flare candidates with energies ranging from \$4\textbackslash{}cdot10\^\{32\}\$ erg to \$6\textbackslash{}cdot10\^\{34\}\$ erg, of which 596 belong to M45, 155 to M44, and none to M67. We find that flaring activity depends both on \$T\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{eff\}\$, and age. But all flare frequency distributions have similar slopes with \$\textbackslash{}alpha \textbackslash{}approx2.0-2.4\$, supporting a universal flare generation process. We discuss implications for the physical conditions under which flares occur, and how the sample's metallicity and multiplicity affect our results.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses an algorithm for detecting single transits in photometric time-series data. Specifically, we aim to identify asymmetric transits with ingress that is more rapid than egress, as expected for cometary bodies with a significant tail. The algorithm is automated, so can be applied to large samples and only a relatively small number of events need to be manually vetted. We applied this algorithm to all long cadence light curves from the Kepler mission, finding 16 candidate transits with significant asymmetry, 11 of which were found to be artefacts or symmetric transits after manual inspection. Of the 5 remaining events, four are the 0.1\% depth events previously identified for KIC 3542116 and 11084727. We identify HD 182952 (KIC 8027456) as a third system showing a potential comet transit. All three stars showing these events have H-R diagram locations consistent with \$\textbackslash{}sim\$100Myr-old open cluster stars, as might be expected given that cometary source regions deplete with age, and giving credence to the comet hypothesis. If these events are part of the same population of events as seen for KIC 8462852, the small increase in detections at 0.1\% depth compared to 10\% depth suggests that future work should consider whether the distribution is naturally flat, or if comets with symmetric transits in this depth range remain undiscovered. Future searches relying on asymmetry should be more successful if they focus on larger samples and young stars, rather than digging further into the noise.},

The properties of the primary component are found to be \$M\_\{\textbackslash{}rm p\}\textbackslash{}sim1.67 \textbackslash{}rm M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\$, more massive than the cluster turn-off, with \$R\_\{\textbackslash{}rm p\}\textbackslash{}sim1.91 \textbackslash{}rm R\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\$ and \$T\_\{\textbackslash{}rm eff\}=7110\textbackslash{}pm100\$ K. The secondary component is highly oversized and overluminous for its low mass with \$M\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}\textbackslash{}sim0.182 \textbackslash{}rm M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\$, \$R\_\{\textbackslash{}rm s\}\textbackslash{}sim0.864 \textbackslash{}rm R\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\$ and \$T\_\{\textbackslash{}rm eff\}=6875\textbackslash{}pm200\$ K. We identify this secondary star as a bloated (proto) extremely low-mass helium white dwarf. These properties of V106 suggest that it represents a typical Algol-paradox system and that it evolved through a mass-transfer phase which provides insight into its past evolution. We present a detailed binary stellar evolution model for the formation of V106 using the MESA code and find that the mass-transfer phase only ceased about 40 Myr ago. Due to the short orbital period (P=1.4463 d) another mass-transfer phase is unavoidable once the current primary star evolves towards the red giant phase. We argue that V106 will evolve through a common-envelope phase within the next 100 Myr and merge to become a single over-massive giant. The high mass will make it appear young for its true age, which is revealed by the cluster properties. Therefore, V106 is potentially a prototype progenitor of old field giants masquerading as young.},

We extracted the frequencies of the radial and quadrupole modes from its frequency power spectrum and determined its properties using a grid of evolutionary models constructed with MESA. The oscillation frequencies were calculated using the GYRE code and the surface term was corrected using the Ball \& Gizon(2014) prescription. We find that the star has a mass of \$M/M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\} = 1.793\textbackslash{}pm 0.072\$, age \$t=1.48\textbackslash{}pm 0.21\$ Gyr and radius \$R/R\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\} = 10.53\textbackslash{}pm 0.28\$. By analyzing the internal structure of the best-fitting model, we infer the evolutionary status of the star KIC 8263801 as being on the ascending part of the red giant branch, and not on the red clump. This result is verified using a purely asteroseismic diagnostic, the \$\textbackslash{}epsilon\_\{c\}-\textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\{c\}\$ diagram which can distinguish red giant branch stars from red clump stars. Finally, by comparing its age with NGC 6866 (\$t=0.65 \textbackslash{}pm 0.1\$ Gyr) we conclude that KIC 8263801 is not a member of this open cluster.},

  abstract = {In recent years the global seismic scaling relations for the frequency of maximum power and for the large frequency separation have caught the attention of various fields of astrophysics. With the exquisite photometry of \textbackslash{}textit\{Kepler\}, the uncertainties in the seismic observables are small enough to estimate masses and radii with a precision of only a few per cent. Even though this seems to work quite well for main-sequence stars, there is empirical evidence, mainly from studies of eclipsing binary systems, that the seismic scaling relations overestimate the mass and radius of red giants by about 15 and 5\textbackslash\%, respectively. Model-based corrections of the \$\textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu -\$scaling reduce the problem but do not solve it. We re-examine the global oscillation parameters of the giants in the binary systems in order to determine their seismic fundamental parameters and find them to agree with the dynamic parameters from the literature if we adopt nonlinear scalings. We note that a curvature and glitch corrected \$\textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{cor\}\$ should be preferred over a local or average values. We then compare the observed seismic parameters of the cluster giants to those scaled from independent measurements and find the same nonlinear behaviour as for the eclipsing binaries. Our final proposed scaling relations are based on both samples and cover a broad range of evolutionary stages from RGB to RC stars: \$g/\textbackslash{}sqrt\{T\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{eff\}\} = (\textbackslash{}nu\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{max\}/\textbackslash{}nu\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{max,\textbackslash{}odot\})\^\{1.0075\textbackslash{}pm0.0021\}\$ and \$\textbackslash{}sqrt\{\textbackslash{}bar\textbackslash{}rho\} = (\textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{cor\}/\textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{cor,\textbackslash{}odot\})[\textbackslash{}eta - (0.0085\textbackslash{}pm0.0025) \textbackslash{}log\^2 (\textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{cor\}/\textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{cor,\textbackslash{}odot\})]\^\{-1\}\$, where \$g\$, \$T\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{eff\}\$, and \$\textbackslash{}bar\textbackslash{}rho\$ are in solar units, \$\textbackslash{}nu\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{max,\textbackslash{}odot\}=3140\textbackslash{}pm5\textbackslash{}mu\$Hz and \$\textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{cor,\textbackslash{}odot\}=135.08\textbackslash{}pm0.02\textbackslash{}mu\$Hz , and \$\textbackslash{}eta\$ is equal to one in case of RGB stars and \$1.04\textbackslash{}pm0.01\$ for RC stars.},

  abstract = {In very young clusters, stellar age distribution is the empirical proof of the duration of star formation (SF) and of the physical mechanisms involved in the process. We derived accurate stellar ages for the cluster NGC6530, associated with the Lagoon Nebula to infer its SF history. We use the Gaia-ESO survey observations and Gaia DR2 data, to derive cluster membership and fundamental stellar parameters. We identified 652 confirmed and 9 probable members. The reddening inferred for members and non-members allows us to distinguish MS stars and giants, in agreement with the distances inferred from Gaia DR2 data. The foreground and background stars show a spatial pattern that traces the 3D structure of the nebular dust component. We derive stellar ages for 382 confirmed cluster members and we find that the gravity-sensitive gamma index distribution for M stars is correlated with stellar age. For all members with Teff{$<$}5500 K, the mean logarithmic age is 5.84 (units of years) with a dispersion of 0.36 dex. The age distribution of stars with accretion and/or disk (CTTSe) is similar to that of stars without accretion and without disk (WTTSp). We interpret this dispersion as evidence of a real age spread since the total uncertainties on age determinations, derived from Monte Carlo simulations, are significantly smaller than the observed spread. This conclusion is supported by the evidence of a decreasing of the gravity-sensitive gamma index as a function of stellar ages. The presence of the age spread is also supported by the spatial distribution and the kinematics of old and young members. In particular, members with accretion and/or disk, formed in the last 1 Myr, show evidence of subclustering around the cluster center, in the Hourglass Nebula and in the M8-E region, suggesting a possible triggering of star formation events by the O-type star ionization fronts.},

  abstract = {Using data from Gaia DR2, we study the radial number density profiles of the Galactic globular cluster sample. Proper motions are used for accurate membership selection, especially crucial in the cluster outskirts. Due to the severe crowding in the centres, the Gaia data is supplemented by literature data from HST and surface brightness measurements, where available. This results in 81 clusters with a complete density profile covering the full tidal radius (and beyond) for each cluster. We model the density profiles using a set of single-mass models ranging from King and Wilson models to generalised lowered isothermal limepy models and the recently introduced spes models, which allow for the inclusion of potential escapers. We find that both King and Wilson models are too simple to fully reproduce the density profiles, with King (Wilson) models on average underestimating(overestimating) the radial extent of the clusters. The truncation radii derived from the limepy models are similar to estimates for the Jacobi radii based on the cluster masses and their orbits. We show clear correlations between structural and environmental parameters, as a function of Galactocentric radius and integrated luminosity. Notably, the recovered fraction of potential escapers correlates with cluster pericentre radius, luminosity and cluster concentration. The ratio of half mass over Jacobi radius also correlates with both truncation parameter and PE fraction, showing the effect of Roche lobe filling.},

  abstract = {Our scientific goal is to provide a 3D map of the nearest open cluster to the Sun, the Hyades, combining the recent release of Gaia astrometric data, ground-based parallaxes of sub-stellar member candidates and photometric data from surveys which cover large areas of the cluster. We combined the second Gaia release with ground-based H-band parallaxes obtained with the infrared camera on the 2-m robotic Liverpool telescope to astrometrically identify stellar and sub-stellar members of the Hyades, the nearest open cluster to the Sun. We find 1764 objects within 70 degree radius from the cluster center from the Gaia second data release, whose kinematic properties are consistent with the Hyades. We limit our study to 30 pc from the cluster center (47.03+/-0.20 pc) where we identify 710 candidate members, including 85 and 385 in the core and tidal radius, respectively. We determine proper motions and parallaxes of eight candidate brown dwarf members and confirm their membership. Using the 3D positions and a model-based mass-luminosity relation we derive a luminosity and mass function in the 0.04 to 2.5 Msun range. We confirm evidence for mass segregation in the Hyades and find a dearth of brown dwarfs in the core of the cluster. From the white dwarf members we estimate an age of 640\$\^\{+67\}\_\{-49\}\$ Myr. We identify a list of members in the Hyades cluster from the most massive stars down to the brown dwarfs. We produce for the first time a 3D map of the Hyades cluster in the stellar and sub-stellar regimes and make available the list of candidate members.},

  title = {Inferring the Distance to {{Westerlund}} 1 from {{Gaia DR2}}},
  abstract = {Westerlund 1 (Wd1) is potentially the largest star cluster in the Galaxy. That designation critically depends upon the distance to the cluster, yet the cluster is highly obscured, making luminosity-based distance estimates difficult. Using Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) parallaxes and Bayesian inference, we infer a parallax of \$0.31\textbackslash{}pm\{0.04\}\$ mas corresponding to a distance of \$3.2\textbackslash{}pm\{0.4\}\$ kpc. To leverage the combined statistics of all stars in the direction of Wd1, we derive the Bayesian model for a cluster of stars hidden among Galactic field stars; this model includes both the zero-point and astrometric excess noise. We infer the exponential length scale, \$L\$, for field stars; \$L = 0.84\_\{-0.03\}\^\{+0.02\}\$ kpc. This is \textasciitilde{}1.7 times smaller than the models used for Bailer-Jones et al. (2018). Previous estimates for the distance to Wd1 ranged from 1.2 to 5.5 kpc, although values around 5 kpc have usually been adopted. The Gaia DR2 parallaxes reduce the uncertainty from a factor of 3 to 15\% and rules out the most often quoted value of 5 kpc with 99\% confidence. This new distance allows for more accurate mass and age determinations for the stars in Wd1. For example, the previously inferred initial mass at the main sequence turnoff was around 40 \$M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\$; the new Gaia DR2 distance shifts this down to about 25 \$M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\$. This has important implications for our understanding of late stages of stellar evolution, including the initial mass of the magnetar and the LBV in Wd1. Similarly, the new distance suggests that the total cluster mass is about three times lower than previously calculated.},

We computed the present-day cluster mass using its luminosity and mass function, and derived an estimate of 234\$\textbackslash{}pm\$52 \$M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\$. We also estimated the cluster original mass using available recipes extracted from N-body simulations obtaining a mass at birth of 50000\$\textbackslash{}pm\$6500 \$M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\$. Therefore dynamical mass loss, mostly caused by tidal interaction with the Milky Way, reduced the cluster mass by about 99\textbackslash\%.

This extinction is twice as high as generally accepted due to a rather high extinction between 625 and 2000 nm.

  abstract = {We use stellar proper motions (PM) from Gaia Data Release 2 for studying the internal kinematics of Milky Way globular clusters. In addition to statistical measurement errors, there are significant spatially correlated systematic errors, which cannot be ignored when studying the internal kinematics. We develop a mathematically consistent procedure for incorporating the spatial correlations in any model-fitting approach, and use it to determine rotation and velocity dispersion profiles of a few dozen clusters. We confirm detection of rotation in the sky plane for \textasciitilde{}10 clusters reported in previous studies, and discover a few more clusters with rotation amplitudes exceeding \textasciitilde{}0.05 mas/yr. However, in more than half of these cases the significance of this rotation signature is rather low when taking into account the systematic errors. We find that the PM dispersion is not sensitive to systematic errors in PM, however, it is quite sensitive to the selection criteria on the input sample, most importantly, in crowded central regions. When using the cleanest possible samples, PM dispersion can be reliably measured down to 0.1 mas/yr for \textasciitilde{}60 clusters.},

  abstract = {We present photometric analysis of twelve Galactic open clusters and show that the same multiple-population phenomenon observed in Magellanic Clouds (MCs) is present in nearby open clusters. Nearly all the clusters younger than \$\textbackslash{}sim\$2.5 Gyr of both MCs exhibit extended main-sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs) and all the cluster younger than \$\textbackslash{}sim\$700 Myr show broadened/split main sequences (MSs). High-resolution spectroscopy has revealed that these clusters host stars with a large spread in the observed projected rotations. In addition to rotation, internal age variation is indicated as a possible responsible for the eMSTOs, making these systems the possible young counterparts of globular clusters with multiple populations. Recent work has shown that the eMSTO+broadened MSs are not a peculiarity of MCs clusters. Similar photometric features have been discovered in a few Galactic open clusters, challenging the idea that the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of these systems are similar to single isochrones and opening new windows to explore the eMSTO phenomenon. We exploit photometry+proper motions from Gaia DR2 to investigate the CMDs of open clusters younger than \$\textbackslash{}sim\$1.5 Gyr. Our analysis suggests that: (i) twelve open clusters show eMSTOs and/or broadened MSs, that cannot be due neither to field contamination, nor binaries; (ii) split/broadened MSs are observed in clusters younger than \$\textbackslash{}sim\$700 Myr, while older objects display only an eMSTO, similarly to MCs clusters; (iii) the eMSTO, if interpreted as a pure age spread, increases with age, following the relation observed in MCs clusters and demonstrating that rotation is the responsible for this phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Context. Open clusters are very good tracers of the evolution of the Galactic disc. Thanks to Gaia, their kinematics can be investigated with an unprecedented precision and accuracy. Aims. The distribution of open clusters in the 6D phase space is revisited with Gaia DR2. Methods. The weighted mean radial velocity of open clusters was determined, using the most probable members available from a previous astrometric investigation that also provided mean parallaxes and proper motions. Those parameters, all derived from Gaia DR2 only, were combined to provide the 6D phase space information of 861 clusters. The velocity distribution of nearby clusters was investigated, as well as the spatial and velocity distributions of the whole sample as a function of age. A high quality subsample was used to investigate some possible pairs and groups of clusters sharing the same Galactic position and velocity. Results. For the high quality sample that has 406 clusters, the median uncertainty of the weighted mean radial velocity is 0.5 km/s. The accuracy, assessed by comparison to ground-based high resolution spectroscopy, is better than 1 km/s. Open clusters nicely follow the velocity distribution of field stars in the close Solar neighbourhood previously revealed by Gaia DR2. As expected, the vertical distribution of young clusters is very flat but the novelty is the high precision to which this can be seen. The dispersion of vertical velocities of young clusters is at the level of 5 km/s. Clusters older than 1 Gyr span distances to the Galactic plane up to 1 kpc with a vertical velocity dispersion of 14 km/s, typical of the thin disc. Five pairs of clusters and one group with five members are possibly physically related. Other binary candidates previously identified turn out to be chance alignment.},

  abstract = {Main sequence turnoff ages in young open clusters are complicated by turnoffs that are sparse, have high binarity fractions, can be affected by differential reddening, and typically include a number of peculiar stars. Furthermore, stellar rotation can have a significant effect on a star's photometry and evolutionary timescale. In this paper we analyze in 12 nearby open clusters, ranging from ages of 50 Myr to 350 Myr, how broadband UBV color-color relations can be used to identify turnoff stars that are Be stars, blue stragglers, certain types of binaries, or those affected by differential reddening. This UBV color-color analysis also directly measures a cluster's E(B-V) and estimates its [Fe/H]. The turnoff stars unaffected by these peculiarities create a narrower and more clearly defined cluster turnoff. Using four common isochronal models, two of which consider rotation, we fit cluster parameters using these selected turnoff stars and the main sequence. Comparisons of the photometrically fit cluster distances to those based on Gaia DR2 parallaxes find that they are consistent for all clusters. For older ({$>$}100 Myr) clusters, like the Pleiades and the Hyades, comparisons to ages based on the lithium depletion boundary method finds that these cleaned turnoff ages agree to within \textasciitilde{}10\% for all four isochronal models. For younger clusters, however, only the Geneva models that consider rotation fit turnoff ages consistent with lithium-based ages, while the ages based on non-rotating isochrones quickly diverge to become 30\% to 80\% younger. This illustrates the importance of rotation for deriving ages in the youngest ({$<$}100 Myr) clusters.},

  abstract = {By far, the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of Galactic open clusters have been considered proto-types of single stellar populations. By using photometry in ultraviolet and optical bands we discovered that the nearby young cluster NGC6705 (M11) exhibits an extended main-sequence turn off (eMSTO) and a broadened main-sequence (MS). This is the first evidence of multiple stellar populations in a Galactic open cluster. By using high-resolution VLT spectra we provide direct evidence that the multiple sequences along the CMD correspond to stellar populations with different rotation rates. Specifically, the blue MS is formed of slow-rotating stars, while red-MS stars are fast rotators. Moreover, we exploit photometry from Gaia DR2 to show that three Galactic open clusters, namely NGC2099, NGC2360, and NGC2818, exhibit the eMSTO, thus suggesting that it is a common feature among these objects. Our previous work on the Large Magellanic Cloud star cluster NGC1818 shows that slowly and fastly-rotating stars populate the blue and red MS observed in its CMD. The similarities between M11 and the young clusters of the Magellanic Clouds suggest that rotation is responsible for the appearance of multiple populations in the CMDs of both Milky Way open clusters and Magellanic Clouds young clusters.},

Using Gaia DR2 proper motions and parallax measurements we are able to select a clean sample of cluster members. This cluster displays a clear extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO), a phenomenon previously studied mainly in young and intermediate age massive clusters in the Magellanic clouds. The main sequence of NGC\textasciitilde{}2818 is extremely narrow, with a width of \$\textbackslash{}sim0.01\$ magnitudes (G\$\_\{\textbackslash{}rm BP\} - \$ G\$\_\{\textbackslash{}rm RP\}\$), suggesting very low levels of differential extinction. Using VLT/FLAMES spectroscopy of 60 cluster members to measure the rotational velocity of the stars (Vsini) we find that stars on the red side of the eMSTO have high Vsini (\${$>$}160\$\textasciitilde{}km/s) while stars on the blue side have low Vsini (\${$<$}160\$\textasciitilde{}km/s), in agreement with model predictions. The cluster also follows the previously discovered trend between the age of the cluster and the extent of the eMSTO. We conclude that stellar rotation is the likely cause of the eMSTO phenomenon.},

  abstract = {We use the framework developed as part of the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks (MIST) project to assess the utility of several types of observables in jointly measuring the age and 1D stellar model parameters in star clusters. We begin with a pedagogical overview summarizing the effects of stellar model parameters, such as the helium abundance, mass-loss efficiency, and the mixing length parameter, on observational diagnostics including the color-magnitude diagram, mass-radius relation, and surface abundances, amongst others. We find that these parameters and the stellar age influence observables in qualitatively distinctive, degeneracy-breaking ways. To assess the current state of affairs, we use the recent Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) along with data from the literature to investigate three well-studied old open clusters---NGC6819, M67, NGC6791---as case studies. Although there is no obvious tension between the existing observations and the MIST models for NGC6819, there are interesting discrepancies in the cases of M67 and NGC6791. At this time, parallax zero point uncertainties in Gaia DR2 remain one of the limiting factors in the analysis of these clusters. With a combination of exquisite photometry, parallax distances, and cluster memberships from Gaia at the end of its mission, we anticipate precise and accurate ages for these and other star clusters in the Galaxy.},

  abstract = {Open clusters are convenient probes of the structure and history of the Galactic disk. They are also fundamental to stellar evolution studies. The second Gaia data release contains precise astrometry at the sub-milliarcsecond level and homogeneous photometry at the mmag level, that can be used to characterise a large number of clusters over the entire sky. In this study we aim to a establish list of members and derive mean parameters, in particular distances, for as many clusters as possible, making use of Gaia data alone. We compile a list of thousands of known or putative clusters from the literature. We then apply an unsupervised membership assignment code, UPMASK, to the Gaia DR2 data contained within the fields of those clusters. We obtained a list of members and cluster parameters for 1229 clusters. As expected, the youngest clusters are seen to be tightly distributed near the Galactic plane and to trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way, while older objects are more uniformly distributed, deviate further from the plane, and tend to be located at larger Galactocentric distances. Thanks to the quality of GaiaDR2 astrometry, the fully homogeneous parameters derived in this study are the most precise to date. Furthermore, we report on the serendipitous discovery of 60 new open clusters in the fields analysed during this study.},

The search for Open Clusters, groups of stars that were born and move together, located in the disk, is a great example for the application of these techniques. Our aim is to develop a method to automatically explore the data space, requiring minimal manual intervention. We explore the performance of a density based clustering algorithm, DBSCAN, to find clusters in the data together with a supervised learning method such as an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to automatically distinguish between real Open Clusters and statistical clusters. The development and implementation of this method to a \$5\$-Dimensional space (\$l\$, \$b\$, \$\textbackslash{}varpi\$, \$\textbackslash{}mu\_\{\textbackslash{}alpha\^*\}\$, \$\textbackslash{}mu\_\textbackslash{}delta\$) to the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) data, and a posterior validation using Gaia DR2 data, lead to the proposal of a set of new nearby Open Clusters.

A correct inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity of the transformation and the asymmetry of the resulting probability distribution.

This is done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval.

We identified 167 member candidates of Upper Scorpius, of which 78 are new, distributed within a 10\$\^\{\textbackslash{}circ\}\$ radius from its core.

The Specific Object Study (SOS) pipeline, developed to validate and fully characterise Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars (SOS Cep\&RRL) observed by Gaia, has been presented in the documentation and papers accompanying the Gaia first Data Release. Here we describe how the SOS pipeline was modified to allow for processing the Gaia multiband (G, G\_BP and G\_RP) time series photometry of all-sky candidate variables and produce specific results for confirmed RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids that are published in the DR2 catalogue. The SOS Cep\&RRL processing uses tools such as the period-amplitude and the period-luminosity relations in the G band. For the analysis of the Gaia DR2 candidates we also used tools based on the G\_BP and G\_RP photometry, such as the period-Wesenheit relation in (G,G\_RP). Multiband time series photometry and characterisation by the SOS Cep\&RRL pipeline are published in Gaia DR2 for 150,359 such variables (9,575 classified as Cepheids and 140,784 as RR Lyrae stars) distributed all over the sky. The sample includes variables in 87 globular clusters and 14 dwarf galaxies. To the best of our knowledge, as of 25 April 2018, variability of 50,570 of these sources (350 Cepheids and 50,220 RR Lyrae stars) is not known in the literature, hence likely they are new discoveries by Gaia. An estimate of the interstellar absorption is published for 54,272 fundamental-mode RR Lyrae stars from a relation based on the G-band amplitude and the pulsation period. Metallicities derived from the Fourier parameters of the light curves are also released for 64,932 RR Lyrae stars and 3,738 fundamental-mode classical Cepheids with period shorter than 6.3 days.},

  abstract = {Results of stellar evolution calculations and results of non-adiabatic stellar pulsation calculations can be used to construct theoretical, composition-dependent short-period boundaries (or ``blue edges'') of the instability strip in the period-luminosity plane for Cepheids pulsating in the fundamental and first overtone radial modes. The slopes of these blue edges are very similar to the slopes of the blue edges of instability strips defined by observed Cepheids in external galaxies. By insisting that the theoretical and observed blue edges coincide for any chosen galaxy, one may estimate the distance to that galaxy. The result is very similar to a distance estimated with the help of an empirical period-magnitude relationship normalized by main-sequence fitting. In addition, masses of Cepheids obtained using the periods, surface temperatures, and luminosities (consistent with the derived distance modulus) in a relationship between these quantities derived by pulsation theory defines a semiempirical mass-luminosity relationship which is consistent with the one defined by the theoretical evolution calculations which have been used to construct the theoretical blue edges. Even so, given existing uncertainties in the theoretical evolutionary models, there is no guarantee that the distance moduli and the mass-luminosity relationships derived in this way are correct. However, most remarkably, a forced change in the adopted distance to a group of extragalactic Cepheids does not destroy the coincidence between theoretical blue edges and blue edges defined by the observed Cepheids. When, with the help of pulsation theory, the revised mass-luminosity relationship defined by the observed Cepheids (at the new distance) is inserted into the equation for the theoretical blue edge, this edge moves in such a way as to remain in contact with the blue edge defined by the Cepheids at the new distance. This means that results of calculations using pulsation theory are consistent with the observations, whatever the distance modulus.},

  abstract = {We analyzed high-precision Kepler photometry and high\textendash{}resolution UVES and GIRAFFE spectroscopy from ESO Science Archieve for a double\textendash{}lined eclipsing binary star in the field of the high metallicity old open cluster NGC 6791. Earlier measurements of the masses and radii of the detached system were not accurate enough for photometric and spectroscopic data to demonstrate that there are significant differences between current stellar models. Here we improved on the result and add follow-up measurements of the system. Data from the Kepler archive makes it clear that the system has an inclination that is close to 90\textdegree. The combination of radial velocity and Kepler light curve of the system were analysed simultaneously, which allows us to determine a reliable mass for the primary and secondary star and radii for both stars, and to constrain the cluster age. The characteristics of the primary star at the cluster turnoff indicate an age of 8.5 {$\pm$} 0.12 Gyr, consistent with earlier analysis of the color\textendash{}magnitude diagram. The brighter star in the binary also produces a precision estimate of the distance modulus, independent of reddening estimates: (m-M)V (mag)=13.899 {$\pm$} 0.117. The secondary star is not expected to have evolved significantly, but its radius is more than 10\% larger than predicted by models. The hallmark is useful for testing the idea that radius inflation can occur in short period binaries for stars with significant convective envelopes due to the inhibition of energy transport by magnetic fields.},

  abstract = {The effect of metallicity on the granulation activity in stars is still poorly understood. Available spectroscopic parameters from the updated APOGEE-\textbackslash{}textit\{Kepler\} catalog, coupled with high-precision photometric observations from NASA's \textbackslash{}textit\{Kepler\} mission spanning more than four years of observation, make oscillating red giant stars in open clusters crucial testbeds. We determine the role of metallicity on the stellar granulation activity by discriminating its effect from that of different stellar properties such as surface gravity, mass, and temperature. We analyze 60 known red giant stars belonging to the open clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6819, and NGC 6811, spanning a metallicity range from [Fe/H] \$\textbackslash{}simeq -0.09\$ to \$0.32\$. The parameters describing the granulation activity of these stars and their \$\textbackslash{}nu\_\textbackslash{}mathrm\{max\}\$, are studied by considering the different masses, metallicities, and stellar evolutionary stages. We derive new scaling relations for the granulation activity, re-calibrate existing ones, and identify the best scaling relations from the available set of observations. We adopted the Bayesian code DIAMONDS for the analysis of the background signal in the Fourier spectra of the stars. We performed a Bayesian parameter estimation and model comparison to test the different model hypotheses proposed in this work and in the literature. Metallicity causes a statistically significant change in the amplitude of the granulation activity, with a dependency stronger than that induced by both stellar mass and surface gravity. We also find that the metallicity has a significant impact on the corresponding time scales of the phenomenon. The effect of metallicity on the time scale is stronger than that of mass. A higher metallicity increases the amplitude of granulation and meso-granulation signals and slows down their characteristic time scales toward longer periods.},

Key to this time-stamping is the cluster NGC 6791, whose stellar members have mean abundances that place it in the high-\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$, high-[Fe/H] region of the [\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane. Based on the cluster's age (\$\textbackslash{}sim 8\$ Gyr), Galactocentric radius, and height above the Galactic plane, as well as comparable chemistry reported for APOGEE stars in Baade's Window, we suggest that the two most likely origins for NGC 6791 are as an original part of the thick-disk, or as a former member of the Galactic bulge. Moreover, because NGC 6791 lies at the \textbackslash{}textit\{high metallicity end\} ([Fe/H] \$\textbackslash{}sim 0.4\$) of the high-\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$ sequence, the age of NGC 6791 places a limit on the \textbackslash{}textit\{youngest age\} of stars in the high-metallicity, high-\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$ sequence for the cluster's parent population (i.e., either the bulge or the disk). In a similar way, we can also use the age and chemistry of NGC 188 to set a limit of \$\textbackslash{}sim 7\$ Gyr on the \textbackslash{}textit\{oldest age\} of the low-\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$ sequence of the Milky Way. Therefore, NGC 6791 and NGC 188 are potentially a pair of star clusters that bracket both the timing and the duration of an important transition point in the chemical history of the Milky Way.},

  abstract = {Stellar clusters form by gravitational collapse of turbulent molecular clouds, with up to several thousand stars per cluster. They are thought to be the birthplace of most stars and therefore play an important role in our understanding of star formation, a fundamental problem in astrophysics. The initial conditions of the molecular cloud establish its dynamical history until the stellar cluster is born. However, the evolution of the cloud's angular momentum during cluster formation is not well understood. Current observations have suggested that turbulence scrambles the angular momentum of the cluster-forming cloud, preventing spin alignment amongst stars within a cluster. Here we use asteroseismology to measure the inclination angles of spin axes in 48 stars from the two old open clusters NGC\textasciitilde{}6791 and NGC\textasciitilde{}6819. The stars within each cluster show strong alignment. Three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of proto-cluster formation show that at least 50 \% of the initial proto-cluster kinetic energy has to be rotational in order to obtain strong stellar-spin alignment within a cluster. Our result indicates that the global angular momentum of the cluster-forming clouds was efficiently transferred to each star and that its imprint has survived after several gigayears since the clusters formed.},

The linewidths are obtained from extensive peakbagging of Kepler lightcurves. These observational results are of unprecedented quality owing to the long continuous observations by Kepler. The uniqueness of the Kepler mission also means that, for asteroseismic properties, this is the best data that will be available for a long time to come. We therefore take great care in modelling nine RGB stars in NGC 6819 using information from 3D simulations to obtain realistic temperature stratifications and calibrated turbulent pressure profiles. Our modelled damping rates reproduce well the Kepler observations, including the characteristic depression in the linewidths around the frequency of maximum oscillation power. Furthermore, we thoroughly test the sensitivity of the calculated damping rates to changes in the parameters of the nonlocal convection model.},

They have been analyzed to determine the chemical abundances of four open clusters with close to solar metallicity; NGC 6811, NGC 6819, M67 and NGC 188. The abundances are derived from equivalent widths of spectral lines using ATLAS9 model atmospheres with parameters determined from the excitation and ionization balance of Fe lines. Results from asteroseismology and binary studies were used as priors on the atmospheric parameters, where especially the \$\textbackslash{}log g\$ is determined to much higher precision than what is possible with spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the four open clusters are close to solar metallicity and they follow the [Y/Mg] vs. age trend previously found for solar twins. The [Y/Mg] vs. age clock also works for giant stars in the helium-core burning phase, which vastly increases the possibilities to estimate the age of stars not only in the solar neighborhood, but in large parts of the Galaxy, due to the brighter nature of evolved stars compared to dwarfs.},

these values. We identify five BSs with significant barium enhancement. These
stars most likely formed through mass transfer from an asymptotic giant branch
star that polluted the surface of the BS with the nucleosynthesis products
generated during thermal pulsations. This conclusion aligns with the results
from the substantial work done on the BSs in old open cluster NGC 188 that
identifies mass transfer as the dominant mechanism for BS formation in that
open cluster. However, four of the BSs with enhanced barium show no
radial-velocity evidence for a companion. The one star that is in a binary is a
double-lined system, meaning the companion is not a white dwarf and not the
remnant of a prior AGB star. In this paper we attempt to develop a consistent

Most of such determinations are, up to now, based on simple scaling relations involving the large frequency separation, \textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu, and the frequency of maximum power, \textbackslash{}nu\$\_\{max\}\$. In this work, we implement \textbackslash{}Delta\textbackslash{}nu\textbackslash{} and the period spacing, \{\textbackslash{}Delta\}P, computed along detailed grids of stellar evolutionary tracks, into stellar isochrones and hence in a Bayesian method of parameter estimation. Tests with synthetic data reveal that masses and ages can be determined with typical precision of 5 and 19 per cent, respectively, provided precise seismic parameters are available. Adding independent information on the stellar luminosity, these values can decrease down to 3 and 10 per cent respectively. The application of these methods to NGC 6819 giants produces a mean age in agreement with those derived from isochrone fitting, and no evidence of systematic differences between RGB and RC stars. The age dispersion of NGC 6819 stars, however, is larger than expected, with at least part of the spread ascribable to stars that underwent mass-transfer events.},

By employing sophisticated pre-processing of the time series and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques we extracted individual frequencies, heights and linewidths for hundreds of oscillation modes. We show that the "average" asteroseismic parameter \$\textbackslash{}delta\textbackslash{}nu\_\{02\}\$, derived from these, can be used to distinguish the stellar evolutionary state between the red giant branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars. Masses and radii are estimated using asteroseismic scaling relations, both empirically corrected to obtain self-consistency as well as agreement with independent measures of distance, and using updated theoretical corrections. Remarkable agreement is found, allowing the evolutionary state of the giants to be determined exclusively from the empirical correction to the scaling relations. We find a mean mass of the RGB stars and RC stars in NGC 6819 to be \$1.61\textbackslash{}pm0.02\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$ and \$1.64\{\textbackslash{}pm\}0.02\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$, respectively. The difference \$\textbackslash{}Delta M=-0.03\textbackslash{}pm0.01\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}textrm\{M\}\_\textbackslash{}odot\$ is almost insensitive to systematics, suggesting very little RGB mass loss, if any. Stars that are outliers relative to the ensemble reveal overmassive members that likely evolved via mass-transfer in a blue straggler phase. We suggest that KIC 4937011, a low-mass Li-rich giant, is a cluster member in the RC phase that experienced very high mass-loss during its evolution. Such over- and undermassive stars need to be considered when studying field giants, since the true age of such stars cannot be known and there is currently no way to distinguish them from normal stars.},

  title = {Spin Alignment of Stars in Old Open Clusters},
  abstract = {Stellar clusters form by gravitational collapse of turbulent molecular clouds, with up to several thousand stars per cluster. They are thought to be the birthplace of most stars and therefore play an important role in our understanding of star formation, a fundamental problem in astrophysics. The initial conditions of the molecular cloud establish its dynamical history until the stellar cluster is born. However, the evolution of the cloud's angular momentum during cluster formation is not well understood. Current observations have suggested that turbulence scrambles the angular momentum of the cluster-forming cloud, preventing spin alignment amongst stars within a cluster. Here we use asteroseismology to measure the inclination angles of spin axes in 48 stars from the two old open clusters NGC\textasciitilde{}6791 and NGC\textasciitilde{}6819. The stars within each cluster show strong alignment. Three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of proto-cluster formation show that at least 50 \% of the initial proto-cluster kinetic energy has to be rotational in order to obtain strong stellar-spin alignment within a cluster. Our result indicates that the global angular momentum of the cluster-forming clouds was efficiently transferred to each star and that its imprint has survived after several gigayears since the clusters formed.},

  abstract = {As part of our study of the old (\textasciitilde{}2.5 Gyr) open cluster NGC 6819 in the Kepler field, we present photometric (Kepler and ground-based BVRcIc) and spectroscopic observations of the detached eclipsing binary WOCS 24009 (Auner 665; KIC 5023948) with a short orbital period of 3.6 days. WOCS 24009 is a triple-lined system, and we verify that the brightest star is physically orbiting the eclipsing binary using radial velocities and eclipse timing variations. The eclipsing binary components have masses M\_B =1.090+/-0.010 Msun and M\_C =1.075+/-0.013 Msun, and radii R\_B =1.095+/-0.007 Rsun and R\_C =1.057+/-0.008 Rsun. The bright non-eclipsing star resides at the cluster turnoff, and ultimately its mass will directly constrain the turnoff mass: our preliminary determination is M\_A =1.251+/-0.057 Msun. A careful examination of the light curves indicates that the fainter star in the eclipsing binary undergoes a very brief period of total eclipse, which enables us to precisely decompose the light of the three stars and place them in the color-magnitude diagram. We also present improved analysis of two previously discussed detached eclipsing stars in NGC 6819 (WOCS 40007 and WOCS 23009) en route to a combined determination of the cluster's distance modulus (m-M)\_V=12.38+/-0.04. Because this paper significantly increases the number of measured stars in the cluster, we can better constrain the age of the color-magnitude diagram to be 2.21+/-0.10+/-0.20 Gyr. Additionally, using all measured eclipsing binary star masses and radii, we constrain the age to 2.38+/-0.05+/-0.22 Gyr. The quoted uncertainties are estimates of measurement and systematic uncertainties (due to model physics differences and metal content), respectively.},

  abstract = {Surface and spatial radial density profiles in open clusters are derived using a kernel estimator method. Formulae are obtained for the contribution of every star into the spatial density profile. The evaluation of spatial density profiles is tested against open-cluster models from N-body experiments with N = 500. Surface density profiles are derived for seven open clusters (NGC 1502, 1960, 2287, 2516, 2682, 6819 and 6939) using Two-Micron All-Sky Survey data and for different limiting magnitudes. The selection of an optimal kernel half-width is discussed. It is shown that open-cluster radius estimates hardly depend on the kernel half-width. Hints of stellar mass segregation and structural features indicating cluster non-stationarity in the regular force field are found. A comparison with other investigations shows that the data on open-cluster sizes are often underestimated. The existence of an extended corona around the open cluster NGC 6939 was confirmed. A combined function composed of the King density profile for the cluster core and the uniform sphere for the cluster corona is shown to be a better approximation of the surface radial density profile.The King function alone does not reproduce surface density profiles of sample clusters properly. The number of stars, the cluster masses and the tidal radii in the Galactic gravitational field for the sample clusters are estimated. It is shown that NGC 6819 and 6939 are extended beyond their tidal surfaces.},

  abstract = {High-dispersion spectra of 333 stars in the open cluster NGC 6819, obtained
using the HYDRA spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5m telescope, have been analyzed to
determine the abundances of iron and other metals from lines in the 400 A
region surrounding the Li 6708 A line. Our spectra, with signal-to-noise per
pixel (SNR) ranging from 60 to 300, span the luminosity range from the tip of
the red giant branch to a point two magnitudes below the top of the cluster
turnoff. We derive radial and rotational velocities for all stars, as well as
[Fe/H] based on 17 iron lines, [Ca/H], [Si/H], and [Ni/H] in the 247 most
probable, single members of the cluster. Input temperature estimates for model
atmosphere analysis are provided by (B-V) colors merged from several sources,
with individual reddening corrections applied to each star relative to a
cluster mean of E(B-V) = 0.16. Extensive use is made of ROBOSPECT, an automatic
equivalent width measurement program; its effectiveness on large spectroscopic
samples is discussed. From the sample of likely single members, [Fe/H] = -0.03
+/- 0.06, where the error describes the median absolute deviation about the
sample median value, leading to an internal precision for the cluster below
0.01 dex. The final uncertainty in the cluster abundance is therefore dominated
by external systematics due to the temperature scale, surface gravity, and
microturbulent velocity, leading to [Fe/H] = -0.02 +/- 0.02 for a sub-sample
restricted to main sequence and turnoff stars. This result is consistent with
our recent intermediate-band photometric determination of a slightly subsolar
abundance for this cluster. [Ca/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ni/Fe] are determined to be
solar within the uncertainties. NGC 6819 has an abundance distribution typical
of solar metallicity thin disk stars in the solar neighborhood.},

  title = {The Chemical Homogeneity of Open Clusters},
  abstract = {Determining the level of chemical homogeneity in open clusters is of fundamental importance in the study of the evolution of star-forming clouds and that of the Galactic disk. Yet limiting the initial abundance spread in clusters has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining consistent spectroscopic abundances for different stellar types. Without reference to any specific model of stellar photospheres, a model for a homogeneous cluster is that it forms a one-dimensional sequence, with any differences between members due to variations in stellar mass and observational uncertainties. I present a novel method for investigating the abundance spread in open clusters that tests this one-dimensional hypothesis at the level of observed stellar spectra, rather than constraining homogeneity using derived abundances as traditionally done. Using high-resolution APOGEE spectra for 49 giants in M67, NGC 6819, and NGC 2420 I demonstrate that these spectra form one-dimensional sequences for each cluster. With detailed forward modeling of the spectra and Approximate Bayesian Computation, I derive strong limits on the initial abundance spread of 15 elements: {$<$}0.01 (0.02) dex for C and Fe, {$<\sptilde$}0.015 (0.03) dex for N, O, Mg, Si, and Ni, {$<\sptilde$}0.02 (0.03) dex for Al, Ca, and Mn, and {$<\sptilde$}0.03 (0.05) dex for Na, S, K, Ti, and V (at 68\% and 95\% confidence, respectively). The strong limits on C and O imply that no pollution by massive core-collapse supernovae occurred during star formation in open clusters, which, thus, need to form within {$<\sptilde$}6 Myr. Further development of this and related techniques will bring the power of differential abundances to stars other than solar twins in large spectroscopic surveys and will help unravel the history of star formation and chemical enrichment in the Milky Way through chemical tagging.},

  abstract = {A Li-rich red giant star (2M19411367+4003382) recently discovered in the
direction of NGC 6819 belongs to the rare subset of Li-rich stars that have not
yet evolved to the luminosity bump, an evolutionary stage where models predict
Li can be replenished. The currently favored model to explain Li enhancement in
first-ascent red giants like 2M19411367+4003382 requires deep mixing into the
stellar interior. Testing this model requires a measurement of 12C/13C, which
is possible to obtain from APOGEE spectra. However, the Li-rich star also has
abnormal asteroseismic properties that call into question its membership in the
cluster, even though its radial velocity and location on color-magnitude
diagrams are consistent with membership. To address these puzzles, we have
measured a wide array of abundances in the Li-rich star and three comparison
stars using spectra taken as part of the APOGEE survey to determine the degree
of stellar mixing, address the question of membership, and measure the surface
gravity. We confirm that the Li-rich star is a red giant with the same overall
chemistry as the other cluster giants. However, its log g is significantly
lower, consistent with the asteroseismology results and suggestive of a very
low mass if the star is indeed a cluster member. Regardless of the cluster
membership, the 12C/13C and C/N ratios of the Li-rich star are consistent with
standard first dredge-up, indicating that Li dilution has already occurred, and
inconsistent with internal Li enrichment scenarios that require deep mixing.},

  abstract = {We present the analysis of an eccentric, partially eclipsing long-period (\$P=19.23\$ d) binary system KIC 9777062 that contains main sequence stars near the turnoff of the intermediate age open cluster NGC 6811. The primary is a metal-lined Am star with a possible convective blueshift to its radial velocities, and one star (probably the secondary) is likely to be a \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ Dor pulsator. The component masses are \$1.603\textbackslash{}pm0.006\$(stat.)\$\textbackslash{}pm0.016\$(sys.) and \$1.419\textbackslash{}pm0.003\textbackslash{}pm0.008 M\_\textbackslash{}odot\$, and the radii are \$1.744\textbackslash{}pm0.004\textbackslash{}pm0.002\$ and \$1.544\textbackslash{}pm0.002\textbackslash{}pm0.002 R\_\textbackslash{}odot\$. The isochrone ages of the stars are mildly inconsistent: the age from the mass-radius combination for the primary (\$1.05\textbackslash{}pm0.05\textbackslash{}pm0.09\$ Gyr, where the last quote was systematic uncertainty from models and metallicity) is smaller than that from the secondary (\$1.21\textbackslash{}pm0.05\textbackslash{}pm0.15\$ Gyr) and is consistent with the inference from the color-magnitude diagram (\$1.00\textbackslash{}pm0.05\$ Gyr). We have improved the measurements of the asteroseismic parameters \$\textbackslash{}Delta \textbackslash{}nu\$ and \$\textbackslash{}nu\_\{\textbackslash{}rm max\}\$ for helium-burning stars in the cluster. The masses of the stars appear to be larger (or alternately, the radii appear to be smaller) than predicted from isochrones using the ages derived from the eclipsing stars. The majority of stars near the cluster turnoff are pulsating stars: we identify a sample of 28 \$\textbackslash{}delta\$ Sct, 15 \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ Dor, and 5 hybrid types. We used the period-luminosity relation for high-amplitude \$\textbackslash{}delta\$ Sct stars to fit the ensemble of the strongest frequencies for the cluster members, finding \$(m-M)\_V = 10.37\textbackslash{}pm0.03\$. This is larger than most previous determinations, but smaller than values derived from the eclipsing binary (\$10.47\textbackslash{}pm0.05\$).},

  abstract = {The NASA space telescope Kepler has provided unprecedented time-series
observations which have revolutionised the field of asteroseismology, i.e. the
use of stellar oscillations to probe the interior of stars. The Kepler-data
include observations of stars in open clusters, which are particularly
interesting for asteroseismology. One of the clusters observed with Kepler is
NGC 6811, which is the target of the present paper. However, apart from
high-precision time-series observations, sounding the interiors of stars in
open clusters by means of asteroseismology also requires accurate and precise
atmospheric parameters as well as cluster membership indicators for the
individual stars. We use medium-resolution (R\textasciitilde{}25,000) spectroscopic
observations, and three independent analysis methods, to derive effective
temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, projected rotational velocities
and radial velocities, for 15 stars in the field of the open cluster NGC 6811.
We discover two double-lined and three single-lined spectroscopic binaries.
Eight stars are classified as either certain or very probable cluster members,
and three stars are classified as non-members. For four stars, cluster
membership could not been assessed. Five of the observed stars are G-type
giants which are located in the colour-magnitude diagram in the region of the
red clump of the cluster. Two of these stars are surely identified as red clump
stars for the first time. For those five stars, we provide chemical abundances
of 31 elements. The mean radial-velocity of NGC 6811 is found to be
+6.68\$\textbackslash{}pm\$0.08 km s\$\^\{-1\}\$ and the mean metallicity and overall abundance
pattern are shown to be very close to solar with an exception of Ba which we
find to be overabundant.},

were determined simultaneously via Bayesian statistics using the

versus R-I of the cluster. The resulting most likely parameters were further
confirmed using independent methods, removing any possible degeneracies. The

  abstract = {We studied solar-like oscillations in 115 red giants in the three open
clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6811, and NGC 6819, based on photometric data covering
more than 19 months with NASA's Kepler space telescope. We present the
asteroseismic diagrams of the asymptotic parameters {$\delta\nu\_$}02, {$\delta\nu\_$}01
and {$\epsilon$}, which show clear correlation with fundamental stellar parameters
such as mass and radius. When the stellar populations from the clusters are
compared, we see evidence for a difference in mass of the red giant branch
stars, and possibly a difference in structure of the red clump stars, from our
measurements of the small separations {$\delta\nu\_$}02 and {$\delta\nu\_$}01. Ensemble
{\'e}chelle diagrams and upper limits to the linewidths of l = 0 modes as a
function of {$\Delta\nu$}of the clusters NGC 6791 and NGC 6819 are also shown,
together with the correlation between the l = 0 ridge width and the T\_eff of
the stars. Lastly, we distinguish between red giant branch and red clump stars
through the measurement of the period spacing of mixed dipole modes in 53 stars
among all the three clusters to verify the stellar classification from the
color-magnitude diagram. These seismic results also allow us to identify a
number of special cases, including evolved blue stragglers and binaries, as
well as stars in late He-core burning phases, which can be potentially
interesting targets for detailed theoretical modeling.},

  abstract = {Context: Four open clusters are present in the Kepler field of view and
timeseries of nearly a year in length are now available. These timeseries allow
us to derive asteroseismic global oscillation parameters of red-giant stars in
the three open clusters NGC 6791, NGC 6819 and NGC 6811. From these parameters
and effective temperatures, we derive mass, radii and luminosities for the
clusters as well as field red giants. Aims: We study the influence of evolution
and metallicity on the observed red-giant populations. Methods: The global
oscillation parameters are derived using different published methods and the
effective temperatures are derived from 2MASS colours. The observational
results are compared with BaSTI evolution models. Results: We find that the
mass has significant influence on the asteroseismic quantities delta\_nu vs.
nu\_max relation, while the influence of metallicity is negligible, under the
assumption that the metallicity does not affect the excitation / damping of the
oscillations. The positions of the stars in the H-R diagram depend on both mass
and metallicity. Furthermore, the stellar masses derived for the field stars
are bracketed by those of the cluster stars. Conclusions: Both the mass and
metallicity contribute to the observed difference in locations in the H-R
diagram of the old metal-rich cluster NGC 6791 and the middle-aged
solar-metallicity cluster NGC 6819. For the young cluster NGC 6811, the
explanation of the position of the stars in the H-R diagram challenges the
assumption of solar metallicity, and this open cluster might have significantly
lower metallicity [Fe/H] in the range -0.3 to -0.7 dex. Also, nearly all the
observed field stars seem to be older than NGC 6811 and younger than NGC 6791.},

  abstract = {Mixture models combine multiple components into a single probability density function. They are a natural statistical model for many situations in astronomy, such as surveys containing multiple types of objects, cluster analysis in various data spaces, and complicated distribution functions. This chapter in the CRC Handbook of Mixture Analysis is concerned with astronomical applications of mixture models for cluster analysis, classification, and semi-parametric density estimation. We present several classification examples from the literature, including identification of a new class, analysis of contaminants, and overlapping populations. In most cases, mixtures of normal (Gaussian) distributions are used, but it is sometimes necessary to use different distribution functions derived from astrophysical experience. We also address the use of mixture models for the analysis of spatial distributions of objects, like galaxies in redshift surveys or young stars in star-forming regions. In the case of galaxy clustering, mixture models may not be the optimal choice for understanding the homogeneous and isotropic structure of voids and filaments. However, we show that mixture models, using astrophysical models for star clusters, may provide a natural solution to the problem of subdividing a young stellar population into subclusters. Finally, we explore how mixture models can be used for mathematically advanced modeling of data with heteroscedastic uncertainties or missing values, providing two example algorithms, the measurement error regression model of Kelly (2007) and the Extreme Deconvolution model of Bovy et al. (2011). The challenges presented by astronomical science, aided by the public availability of catalogs from major surveys and missions, are a rich area for collaboration between statisticians and astronomers.},

  abstract = {We present here the final results of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) 
Key Project to measure the Hubble constant. We summarize our method, the
results, and the uncertainties, tabulate our revised distances, and give
the implications of these results for cosmology. Our results are based
on a Cepheid calibration of several secondary distance methods applied
over the range of about 60-400 Mpc. The analysis presented here benefits
from a number of recent improvements and refinements, including (1) a
larger LMC Cepheid sample to define the fiducial period-luminosity (PL)
relations, (2) a more recent HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2
(WFPC2) photometric calibration, (3) a correction for Cepheid
metallicity, and (4) a correction for incompleteness bias in the
observed Cepheid PL samples. We adopt a distance modulus to the LMC
(relative to which the more distant galaxies are measured) of
{$\mu$}0(LMC)=18.50+/-0.10 mag, or 50 kpc. New, revised
distances are given for the 18 spiral galaxies for which Cepheids have
been discovered as part of the Key Project, as well as for 13 additional
galaxies with published Cepheid data. The new calibration results in a
Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 in better agreement with the maser distance
to this galaxy. Based on these revised Cepheid distances, we find values
(in km s-1 Mpc-1) of H0=71+/-2
(random)+/-6 (systematic) (Type Ia supernovae), H0=71+/-3+/-7
(Tully-Fisher relation), H0=70+/-5+/-6 (surface brightness
fluctuations), H0=72+/-9+/-7 (Type II supernovae), and
H0=82+/-6+/-9 (fundamental plane). We combine these results
for the different methods with three different weighting schemes, and
find good agreement and consistency with H0=72+/-8 km
s-1 Mpc-1. Finally, we compare these results with
other, global methods for measuring H0. Based on observations
with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space

To follow this up, we obtained a month long series of observations of the fundamental mode Cepheid RT Aur and the first overtone pulsator SZ Tau. RT Aur shows the traditional strict repetition of the light curve, with the Fourier amplitude ratio R1/R2 remaining nearly constant. The light curve of SZ Tau, on the other hand, fluctuates in amplitude ratio at the level of approximately 50\%. Furthermore prewhitening the RT Aur data with 10 frequencies reduces the Fourier spectrum to noise. For SZ Tau, considerable power is left after this prewhitening in a complicated variety of frequencies.},

We detected 28 frequencies using the standard Fourier transform method. We identified modulation of the main pulsation frequency and its harmonics with a period of \~159 d. This modulation is also present in the Fourier parameters of the light curve and the O - C diagram. We detected another modulation with a period of about 1160 d. The star also shows significant power in the low-frequency region that we identified as granulation noise. The effective time-scale of the granulation agrees with the extrapolated scalings of red giant stars. Non-detection of solar-like oscillations indicates that the pulsation inhibits other oscillations. We obtained new radial velocity observations that are in a perfect agreement with previous years data, suggesting that there is no high-mass star companion of V1154 Cygni. Finally, we discuss the possible origin of the detected frequency modulations.},

The analysis of the first 322 d of Kepler photometry, and recent ground-based follow-up multicolour photometry and spectroscopy allowed us to confirm that one of these stars, V1154 Cyg (KIC 7548061), is indeed a 4.9-d Cepheid. Using the phase lag method, we show that this star pulsates in the fundamental mode. New radial velocity data are consistent with previous measurements, suggesting that a long-period binary component is unlikely. No evidence is seen in the ultraprecise, nearly uninterrupted Kepler photometry for non-radial or stochastically excited modes at the micromagnitude level.

These period changes challenge standard theories of pulsation and evolution because the period change is non-secular, and explaining this period jitter is necessary for understanding stellar evolution and the role of Cepheids as precise standard candles. We suggest that convection and convective hot spots can explain the observed period jitter. Convective hot spots alter the timing of flux maximum and minimum in the Cepheid light curve, hence change the measured pulsation period. We present a model of random hot spots that generate a localized flux excess that perturbs the Cepheid light curve and consequently the pulsation period, which is consistent with the observed jitter. This result demonstrates how important understanding convection is for modeling Cepheid stellar structure and evolution, how convection determines the red edge of the instability strip, and just how sensitive Cepheid light curves are to atmospheric physics.},

period distribution is unimodal and can be approximated by a
Gaussian-type relation with a median period of 180 yrs. (2) The short
binaries are circularized up to orbital periods of about 11 d due to the
tidal evolution effects - a result compatible with the mean age of the
Galactic disk. (3) The tight binaries not affected by tidal effects (in
the range between 11 and 1000 d) may reflect the initial binary
formation process, and they have a mean eccentricity of 0.31 +/-0.04.
For systems with M(2)/M(1) not greater than 0.1, the proportion of brown
dwarf companions among the IAU velocity standards is estimated at 10

  abstract = {The origin of extended main sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs) in intermediate-age (1-3 Gyr) clusters is one of the most intriguing questions in current star cluster research. Unlike the split main sequences found in some globular clusters. which are caused by bimodal populations in age and/or chemical abundances, eMSTOs are believed to be owing to stellar rotation. We present a spectroscopic survey of MSTO stars in a nearby, intermediate-age (\textbackslash{}unit[0.9]\{Gyr\}), low mass (\$\textbackslash{}sim 1.7\textbackslash{}times10\^3 M\_\textbackslash{}odot\$) Galactic open cluster, NGC 5822. We derive a clean sample of member stars based on \textbackslash{}textit\{Gaia\} proper motions and parallaxes and confirm the existence of an eMSTO. Using medium-resolution (\$R\textbackslash{}sim 4000\$) Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) spectra, we derive the rotational velocities of 24 member stars (representing 20\textbackslash\% completeness around the eMSTO region) and find that the loci of the main sequence stars in the eMSTO region show a clear correlation with the projected rotational velocities in the sense that fast rotators are located on the red side of the eMSTO and slow rotators are found on the blue side. By comparison with a synthetic cluster model, we show that the stellar rotational velocities and the eMSTO of NGC 5822 can be well reproduced and we conclude that stellar rotation is the main cause of the eMSTO in NGC 5822.},

  abstract = {Weak magnetic fields have recently been detected in a number of A-type stars, including Vega and Sirius. At the same time, space photometry observations of A- and late B-type stars from Kepler and TESS have highlighted the existence of rotational modulation of surface features akin to stellar spots. Here we explore the possibility that surface magnetic spots might be caused by the presence of small envelope convective layers at or just below the stellar surface, caused by recombination of H and He. Using 1D stellar evolution calculations and assuming an equipartition dynamo, we make simple estimates of field strength at the photosphere. For most models the largest effects are caused by a convective layer driven by second helium ionization. While it is difficult to predict the geometry of the magnetic field, we conclude that the majority of intermediate-mass stars should have dynamo-generated magnetic fields of order a few gauss at the surface. These magnetic fields can appear at the surface as bright spots, and cause photometric variability via rotational modulation, which could also be wide-spread in A-stars. The amplitude of surface magnetic fields and their associated photometric variability is expected to decrease with increasing stellar mass and surface temperature, so that magnetic spots and their observational effects should be much harder to detect in late B-type stars.},

  abstract = {At an age of 4 Gyr, typical solar-type stars in M67 have rotation rates of 20-30 days. Using K2 Campaign 5 and 16 light curves and the spectral archive of the WIYN Open Cluster Study, we identify eleven three-dimensional kinematic members of M67 with anomalously fast rotation periods of 2-8 days, implying ages of less than 1 Gyr. We hypothesize that these anomalously fast rotators have been spun up by mass transfer, mergers, or stellar collisions during dynamical encounters within the last Gyr, and thus represent lower-luminosity counterparts to the blue straggler stars. These 11 candidate post-interaction stellar systems have much in common with the blue stragglers including a high binary fraction (73\%), a number of long-period, low-eccentricity binary systems, and in at least one case a UV excess consistent with the presence of a hot white dwarf companion. The identification of these 11 systems provides the first picture of the low-luminosity end of the blue straggler distribution, providing new constraints for detailed binary evolution models and cluster population studies. This result also clearly demonstrates the need to properly account for the impact of binaries on stellar evolution, as significant numbers of post-interaction binaries likely exist on cluster main sequences and in the field. These stars are not always easy to identify, but make up \textasciitilde{}10\% of the spectroscopic binary population among the solar-type stars in M67.},

We find that stars with masses below \$\textbackslash{}sim\$1.3 \$M\_\{\textbackslash{}odot\}\$ in both \$h\$ and \$\textbackslash{}chi\$ Persei populate narrow main sequences (MSs), while more massive stars define the eMSTO, closely mimicking observations of young Galactic and Magellanic Cloud clusters (with ages older than \$\textbackslash{}sim\$30 Myr). Previous studies based on clusters older than \$\textbackslash{}sim\$30 Myr find that rapidly rotating MS stars are redder than slow rotators of similar luminosity, suggesting that stellar rotation may be the main driver of the eMSTO. By combining photometry and projected rotational velocities from the literature of stars in \$h\$ and \$\textbackslash{}chi\$ Persei, we find no obvious relation between the rotational velocities and colors of non-emission-line eMSTO stars, in contrast with what is observed in older clusters. Similarly to what is observed in Magellanic Cloud clusters, most of the extremely rapidly rotating stars, identified by their strong H\$\textbackslash{}alpha\$ emission lines, are located in the red part of the eMSTOs. This indicates that stellar rotation plays a role in the color and magnitude distribution of MSTO stars. By comparing the observations with simulated CMDs, we find that a simple population composed of coeval stars that span a wide range of rotation rates is unable to reproduce the color spread of the clusters' MSs. We suggest that variable stars, binary interactions, and stellar rotation affect the eMSTO morphology of these very young clusters.},

  shorttitle = {New Light on the {{Gaia DR2}} Parallax Zero-Point},
  abstract = {The importance of studying the Gaia DR2 parallax zero-point by external means was underlined by Lindegren et al. (2018), and initiated by several works making use of Cepheids, eclipsing binaries, and asteroseismology. Despite a very efficient elimination of basic-angle variations, a small fluctuation remains and shows up as a small offset in the Gaia DR2 parallaxes. By combining astrometric, asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and photometric constraints, we undertake a new analysis of the Gaia parallax offset for nearly 3000 red-giant branch (RGB) and 2200 red clump (RC) stars observed by Kepler, as well as about 500 and 700 red giants (both RGB and RC) selected by the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program in campaigns 3 and 6. Engaging into a thorough comparison of the astrometric and asteroseismic parallaxes, we are able to highlight the influence of the asteroseismic method, and measure parallax offsets in the Kepler field that are compatible with independent estimates from literature and open clusters. Moreover, adding the K2 fields to our investigation allows us to retrieve a clear illustration of the positional dependence of the zero-point, in general agreement with the information provided by quasars. Lastly, we initiate a two-step methodology to make progress in the simultaneous calibration of the asteroseismic scaling relations and of the Gaia DR2 parallax offset, which will greatly benefit from the gain in precision with the third Data Release of Gaia.},

  abstract = {We describe the photometric calibration and stellar classification methods used by the Stellar Classification Project to produce the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC). The KIC is a catalog containing photometric and physical data for sources in the Kepler mission field of view; it is used by the mission to select optimal targets. Four of the visible-light (g, r, i, z) magnitudes used in the KIC are tied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey magnitudes; the fifth (D51) is an AB magnitude calibrated to be consistent with Castelli \& Kurucz (CK) model atmosphere fluxes. We derived atmospheric extinction corrections from hourly observations of secondary standard fields within the Kepler field of view. For these filters and extinction estimates, repeatability of absolute photometry for stars brighter than magnitude 15 is typically 2\%. We estimated stellar parameters \{T eff, log (g), log (Z), E B - V \} using Bayesian posterior probability maximization to match observed colors to CK stellar atmosphere models. We applied Bayesian priors describing the distribution of solar-neighborhood stars in the color-magnitude diagram, in log (Z), and in height above the galactic plane. Several comparisons with samples of stars classified by other means indicate that for 4500 K {$<$}=T eff {$<$}= 6500 K, our classifications are reliable within about {$\pm$}200 K and 0.4 dex in
log (g) for dwarfs, with somewhat larger log (g) uncertainties for giants. It is difficult to assess the reliability of our log (Z) estimates, but there is reason to suspect that it is poor, particularly at extreme T eff. Comparisons between the CK models and observed colors are generally satisfactory with some exceptions, notably for stars cooler than 4500 K. Of great importance for the Kepler mission, for T eff {$<$}= 5400 K, comparison with
asteroseismic results shows that the distinction between main-sequence stars and giants is reliable with about 98\% confidence. Larger errors in log (g) occur for warmer stars, for which our filter set provides inadequate gravity diagnostics. The KIC is available through the MAST data archive.},

  shorttitle = {The {{Red}}-{{Giant Branch Bump Revisited}}},
  abstract = {The red-giant branch bump provides valuable information for the investigation
of the internal structure of low-mass stars. Because current models are unable
to accurately predict the occurrence and efficiency of mixing processes beyond
convective boundaries, one can use the luminosity of the bump --- a diagnostic
of the maximum extension of the convective envelope during the first-dredge up
--- as a calibrator for such processes. By combining asteroseismic and
spectroscopic constraints, we expand the analysis of the bump to masses and
metallicities beyond those previously accessible using globular clusters. Our
dataset comprises nearly 3000 red-giant stars observed by \{\textbackslash{}it Kepler\} and with
APOGEE spectra. Using statistical mixture models, we are able to detect the
bump in the average seismic parameters \${$\nu\_\lbrace\backslash$}rm max\}\$ and \$\textbackslash{}langle {$\Delta\nu$}
\textbackslash{}rangle\$, and show that its observed position reveals general trends with mass
and metallicity in line with expectations from models. Moreover, our analysis
indicates that standard stellar models underestimate the depth of efficiently
mixed envelopes. The inclusion of significant overshooting from the base of the
convective envelope, with an efficiency that increases with decreasing
metallicity, allows to reproduce the observed location of the bump.
Interestingly, this trend was also reported in previous studies of globular
clusters.},

  volume = {648},
  abstract = {The Microvariability and Oscillations of STars (MOST) photometric satellite observed three rotations of {$\smallin$} Eri continuously in late 2005. We detected two spots ({$\increment$}m\textasciitilde{}0.01) at different latitudes (20.0d, 31.5d) revolving with different periods (11.35 days, 11.55 days), from which we derive a differential rotation coefficient, k=0.11\textsuperscript{+.03}\textsubscript{-.02}, in agreement with the prediction by Brown and coworkers for a young Sun-like star having roughly twice the solar angular velocity. The light curve was analyzed with the program StarSpotz, a modification of SPOTMODEL by Rib{\'a}rik and coworkers. The best-fitting value for the inclination angle i=30\textsuperscript{deg}+/-3\textsuperscript{deg} is compatible with inclinations already estimated for the disk (\textasciitilde{}25\textdegree{}) and planetary orbit (26.2d). The inclination also leads to an equatorial rotation speed of 3.42 km s\textsuperscript{-1} and the photometric value of vsini=1.7 km s\textsuperscript{-1}. When compared with spectroscopically determined values, the photometric vsini allows, in principle, an independent estimate of the macroturbulent velocity. Both spots would have distorted the radial velocity curve \textasciitilde{}+/-10 m s\textsuperscript{-1} by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, which is similar to the stellar radial velocity ``noise'' detected by others. Details of the StarSpotz model and of the uniqueness tests that we applied in order to arrive at a best solution and realistic estimates of errors in the derived parameters are given.

  abstract = {We present a new three-dimensional map of dust reddening, based on Gaia parallaxes and stellar photometry from Pan-STARRS 1 and 2MASS. This map covers the sky north of a declination of -30 degrees, out to a distance of several kiloparsecs. This new map contains three major improvements over our previous work. First, the inclusion of Gaia parallaxes dramatically improves distance estimates to nearby stars. Second, we incorporate a spatial prior that correlates the dust density across nearby sightlines. This produces a smoother map, with more isotropic clouds and smaller distance uncertainties, particularly to clouds within the nearest kiloparsec. Third, we infer the dust density with a distance resolution that is four times finer than in our previous work, to accommodate the improvements in signal-to-noise enabled by the other improvements. As part of this work, we infer the distances, reddenings and types of 799 million stars. We obtain typical reddening uncertainties that are \textasciitilde{}30\% smaller than those reported in the Gaia DR2 catalog, reflecting the greater number of photometric passbands that enter into our analysis.

We obtained the cluster's distance from the Sun as 1721+/-41 pc and log (age)= 9.85+/-0.05 at Solar metallicity. The relaxation time of the cluster is smaller than the estimated cluster age which suggests that the cluster is dynamically relaxed. Our results agree with the values mentioned in the literature.

  abstract = {Surface and spatial radial density profiles in open clusters are derived using a kernel estimator method. Formulae are obtained for the contribution of every star into the spatial density profile. The evaluation of spatial density profiles is tested against open-cluster models from N-body experiments with N = 500. Surface density profiles are derived for seven open clusters (NGC 1502, 1960, 2287, 2516, 2682, 6819 and 6939) using Two-Micron All-Sky Survey data and for different limiting magnitudes. The selection of an optimal kernel half-width is discussed. It is shown that open-cluster radius estimates hardly depend on the kernel half-width. Hints of stellar mass segregation and structural features indicating cluster non-stationarity in the regular force field are found. A comparison with other investigations shows that the data on open-cluster sizes are often underestimated. The existence of an extended corona around the open cluster NGC 6939 was confirmed. A combined function composed of the King density profile for the cluster core and the uniform sphere for the cluster corona is shown to be a better approximation of the surface radial density profile.The King function alone does not reproduce surface density profiles of sample clusters properly. The number of stars, the cluster masses and the tidal radii in the Galactic gravitational field for the sample clusters are estimated. It is shown that NGC 6819 and 6939 are extended beyond their tidal surfaces.},

period distribution is unimodal and can be approximated by a
Gaussian-type relation with a median period of 180 yrs. (2) The short
binaries are circularized up to orbital periods of about 11 d due to the
tidal evolution effects - a result compatible with the mean age of the
Galactic disk. (3) The tight binaries not affected by tidal effects (in
the range between 11 and 1000 d) may reflect the initial binary
formation process, and they have a mean eccentricity of 0.31 +/-0.04.
For systems with M(2)/M(1) not greater than 0.1, the proportion of brown
dwarf companions among the IAU velocity standards is estimated at 10
percent of the primaries, a value in good agreement with that found in
the G-dwarf sample.},

Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations.

  abstract = {Methods. The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products.
Results. Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330\textendash{}680 nm) and GRP (630\textendash{}1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent.
Conclusions. Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

  abstract = {UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a novel manifold learning technique for dimension reduction. UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.},
